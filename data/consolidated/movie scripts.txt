(The screen first panels up to an arrow being nocked into a bow. The archer behind firmly grips it tight as it was aiming towards the target. The camera reveals Clint Barton holding up a few arrows while mentoring his daughter, Lila Barton, on shooting one.)

CLINT BARTON: How about now?

[Both Lila and Clint giggle, as the camera panels into a long shot showing a target nailed on a tree, and the rest of Barton family having a picnic in the field.]

CLINT BARTON: Alright. Ready your fingers.

COOPER BARTON: Nice.

LAURA BARTON: Nice throw, kiddo.

COOPER BARTON: You go.

LAURA BARTON: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]

LILA BARTON: Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

CLINT BARTON: Probably your brothers.

[Clint looks at his wife, Laura]

CLINT BARTON: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]

LAURA BARTON: Mayo or mustard?

NATHANIEL BARTON: How about ketchup?

LAURA BARTON: Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] I can do ketchup.

CLINT BARTON: Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.

LAURA BARTON: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!

CLINT BARTON: Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?

[Lightning crackles]

[SOMEWHERE IN SPACE]

[Marvel Studios Opening sequence begins with Dear Mr. Fantasy playing. Only the heroes who survived the snap are shown.]

[Scene switches to Nebula and Tony on the ship playing paper football]

NEBULA: Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]

TONY STARK: You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That's a goal. We're now one apiece.

NEBULA: I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]

TONY STARK: We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.

[Tony poorly flicks a paper football towards Nebula]

TONY STARK: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]

TONY STARK: And... you've won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]

TONY STARK: Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] Have fun?

NEBULA: It was fun.

[Camera switches to see Iron Man's busted helmet. Tony Stark's hand reaches forward to turn on the helmet. We pan out to see that he's sitting on the floor of a gloomy Benatar. The weight of the recent events of INFINITY WAR evident in Tony's posture. He taps the helmet with a sigh.]

TONY STARK: This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.

[With that, Tony turns the helmet off. He rubs his thumb over the left eye, and then leans down, to what would be his last sleep. Nebula walks over to him, and carries him to Drax's seat, and lies him there. She walks away dejected.]

[A vast bluish nebula illuminates the space surrounding them. Cut to a shot of Tony's face, which for the first time shows age and weakness. There is a light on his face, which grows brighter and brighter until he's forced to open his eyes. The camera pans around to the light source, which is slowly revealed to be CAROL DANVERS.]

[A bathroom in the Avengers compound. We see Steve Rogers holding a blade, having just shaved off his beard. He sighs and looks into a side mirror. The mirror suddenly starts shaking, slowly at first, and then severely. Cut to the yard in the Avengers Compound, we see Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes walking out looking at something, the Benatar carried by Carol Danvers as she lands the spacecraft. The landing gears deploy as they touch down. The entry hatch opens, and Tony and Nebula walk out, Tony being supported by Nebula. Steve runs to Tony to help him stand up. Tony grips Steve's arm as he joins him.]

TONY STARK: Couldn't stop him.

STEVE ROGERS: Neither could I.

TONY STARK: I lost the kid.

STEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost.

TONY STARK: Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]

PEPPER POTTS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]

TONY STARK: It's okay.

[Rocket Raccoon sits down with Nebula and takes her hand, both silently mourning their losses. In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing. A holographic casualty report lists the names and faces of those lost to the Decimation.]

JAMES RHODES: It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.

TONY STARK: Where is he now? Where?

STEVE ROGERS: We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.

[Cut to a shot of a sullen-looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]

TONY STARK: What's wrong with him?

ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?

TONY STARK: Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

ROCKET: Maybe I am.

STEVE ROGERS: We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.

TONY STARK: Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.

STEVE ROGERS: Okay.

TONY STARK: He's unbeatable.

STEVE ROGERS: Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

TONY STARK: Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.

STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

TONY STARK: [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -

[Tony goes for Steve. Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.]

RHODEY: Tony, Tony, Tony!

TONY STARK: Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!

STEVE ROGERS: Well, that didn't work out, did it?

TONY STARK: I said, "we'd lose". You said, "We'll do that together too." And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.

RHODEY: Okay.

TONY STARK: Right?

RHODEY: You made your point. Just sit down.

TONY STARK: Okay...

RHODEY: Okay?

TONY STARK: Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?

RHODEY: Tony, you're sick.

TONY STARK: [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way.

RHODEY: Sit down. Sit.

TONY STARK: We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve's face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.

[Steve looks affected by Tony's words. The old friends just gaze at each other. After a moment, Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve's hand.]

TONY STARK: Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.

[Tony falls to the ground. Steve is by his side and everyone is starting to gather.]

STEVE ROGERS: Tony!

TONY STARK: I'm fine. I...

[Tony falls into a heap, unconscious.]

[Cut to a shot of Tony on a bed, with Pepper at his side.]

RHODEY: Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

CAROL DANVERS: You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.

[Carol walks away.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you going?

CAROL DANVERS: To kill Thanos.

[Steve and Natasha share a look before walking after her.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

STEVE ROGERS: We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.

RHODEY: You even know where he is?

CAROL DANVERS: I know people who might.

NEBULA: [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask "where would we go once his plan was complete?". His answer was always the same: "To the Garden."

RHODEY: That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.

STEVE ROGERS: So where is he?

ROCKET: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet.

NEBULA: Thanos is there.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: He used the stones again.

BRUCE BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know.

RHODEY: Look, he's still got the stones, so...

CAROL DANVERS: So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.

RHODEY: Just like that?

STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, just like that.

[Steve and Carol share a knowing look.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

BRUCE BANNER: If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

CAROL DANVERS: Because before, you didn't have me.

RHODEY: Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?

CAROL DANVERS: There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

[Thor, who has been eating a snack behind all this time, stands up and walks over to Carol. She looks behind at him. He holds his hand up, and catches Stormbreaker as it flies over to him, missing Carol by inches. But Carol doesn't even flinch, instead smiling at the God of Thunder.]

Thor: I like this one. [smiles]

STEVE ROGERS: Let's go get this son of a bitch.

[Title Screen: Avengers: Endgame]

[Cut to a shot of everyone except for Tony aboard the Benatar.]

ROCKET: Okay, who here hasn't been to space?

[Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]

RHODEY: Why?

ROCKET: You better not throw up on my ship.

NEBULA: Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!

[The ship jumps forward into a wormhole, and we see Steve holding onto his seat for dear life. A close up of his eyes show them widening slightly at the exhilaration of this new experience. The ship slows down, and the ship hovers in orbit of the planet seen in the hologram previously. Carol Danvers hovers in front of the Benatar.]

CAROL DANVERS: I'll head down for recon.

[A shot of the passengers inside the Benatar preparing for the impending confrontation.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: This is gonna work, Steve.

STEVE ROGERS: I know it will.

[We see Steve holding a compass with an image of Peggy Carter.]

STEVE ROGERS: Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.

[Carol Danvers approaches the Benatar.]

CAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.

NEBULA: And that's enough.

[Cut to a shot of a scenic lush tropical fauna. It surrounds a shed on a farm. A scarecrow made of Thanos' armour is seen before we cut to a shot focusing on the burnt Infinity Gauntlet on Thanos' arm. He's walking among his crops, harvesting fruit, and putting them in a sack. He walks over to the shed, with a dragging quality to his legs, like it pains him to walk, presumably his living quarters, and tries to sit down, and we see his full face. His whole left side is burnt black with blisters; He looks ridiculously pathetic compared to when we saw him last.]

[Suddenly, Carol Danvers flies through the roof, knocking Thanos down, and grabbing his neck. Bruce in the Hulkbuster armor bursts from the ground, and grabs Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet arm. Thor flies in and slices off the Infinity Gauntlet. Rhodey flies down with Rocket and aims guns on Thanos' head.]

[Captain America walks in his Winter Soldier Outfit, with Natasha right behind him, staring murderously at Thanos. Rocket goes over to the sliced off Infinity Gauntlet, and kicks it over, as everyone realizes that there are no stones in it.]

ROCKET: Oh no.

STEVE ROGERS: Where are they?

CAROL DANVERS: Answer the question!

THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.

BRUCE BANNER: You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]

THANOS: You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]

NATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?

THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.

BRUCE BANNER: You used them two days ago!

THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.

RHODEY: We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.

NEBULA: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.

THANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

[We see Thor's face filled with rage as he raises to summon Stormbreaker, and before anyone can stop him, SLICES Thanos' head off. Thanos' limp body falls to the floor. Nebula wipes off some of the blood spatter.]

ROCKET: What... What did you do?

[Thor looks broken, realizing what he has done.]

THOR: I went for the head.

[Thor slowly walks out of the shed, no real purpose in his steps as the screen blurs to nothingness.]

FIVE

[A pause]

YEARS

[pause]

LATER

[We see shots of New York City, seemingly abandoned. There are a lot of boats gathered around a dock, all abandoned. A baseball stadium comes into view, with no life present at all. The aftermath of the Decimation is evident, and Earth has not coped well.]

[Cut to an abandoned cafe, with a poster on the wall labeled "WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE?". A therapy session is taking place with Steve Rogers and seven other people.]

JOE RUSSO: So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about.

STEVE ROGERS: What did you talk about?

JOE RUSSO: Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.

JIM STARLIN: What about you?

JOE RUSSO: I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

STEVE ROGERS: That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.

[Screen Title: SAN FRANCISCO]

(The camera pans to San Francisco Bridge, all the way to a self-storage facility with a sign saying "U-STORE It, SELF STORAGE", with its interior filled with stored stuff and junk until it spots Luis' van from "Ant-Man and the Wasp", behind a metallic fence with a label named "LANG". A rat crawls over the van's rear windshield and accidentally activates the controls for opening the Quantum Realm, haphazardly activating the Quantum Tunnel. The rear door busts open, flinging Lang outside the van.)

Scott Lang: (grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.) What the hell?

(He manages to stand up, as another electrical failure sparks out of his gauntlets, and now looks around in a confused look.)

Scott Lang: Hope?

(Inside a security office, a security guard (Ken Jeong) reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word "HELP" written on it.)

(Outside the facility, he pulls out a pushcart and looks back seeing the guard giving a stern look from far. He walks around until reaching his hometown, finding a post filled with MISSING posters, abandoned houses, a wrecked car, nothing but desolation. He then sees a kid in a bike pass by.)

Scott Lang: [yells] Kid! Hey kid!

[The kid stops his bike as he stares back in a serious look.]

Scott Lang: What the hell happened here?

[The kid still stares at him and is almost about to tear up, but immediately turns away from him and move on. Lang still gives the same confused look, as he arrives in somewhat a memorial called "THE VANISHED", with all the names of the people who became victims of the Decimation. As Lang arrives on one of the engraved stones, he immediately drops the handle in shock.]

Scott Lang: No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter's name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.

[The camera keeps panning and switching as Lang checks the rest of engraved stones if her daughter's name was in one.]

Scott Lang: [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]

Scott Lang: What?

[Scott is now seen running across the memorial, then to his hometown, only to ring a doorbell at his house, bang on the door, and try opening the door, but is found locked. Then, he sees a feminine figure appear out of a hallway inside. The figure gets closer, revealing a woman in a purple sweater, with her hand pushing towards the glass door's window, and her face filled with amazement, as she unlocked the door. It was Lang's daughter, Cassie, now a grown-up teen since the last five years.]

[Cassie, who hasn't seen him for five years, holds up his face in an emotional sight and starts to smile tearfully. Lang does the same.]

SCOTT LANG: Cassie?

CASSIE LANG: Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]

SCOTT LANG: You're so big!

[Both dad and daughter share a hug once more.]

[The camera cuts to a sunset in San Francisco, showing a metal face with a sign saying in its headings, "RESTRICTED AREA, DO NOT ENTER" with the subtext, "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT, SECURITY ID OR ESCORT REQUIRED", then cuts to a scene inside the New Avengers facility, someone cutting the two bread with peanut butter filling into a couple of triangles, as someone else was speaking. The camera pans up to Romanoff, now having red, long hair, over-colouring her blonde streaks, hearing Rocket Raccoon out about his status so far.]

ROCKET: Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.

[The camera cuts showing a few of the Avengers in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively: Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]

NEBULA: It was an infectious garbage scowl.

ROCKET: So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]

CAROL DANVERS: Well, you were closer.

ROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?

OKOYE: It was a mild subduction under the African plate.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

OKOYE: Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

CAROL DANVERS: Not likely.

ROCKET: What, you gonna get another haircut?

CAROL DANVERS: [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.

ROCKET: [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point.

CAROL DANVERS: So you might not see me for a long time.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.

[Okoye agrees in her language.]

ROCKET: Okay.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright.

[The Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]

CAROL DANVERS: [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]

[Except for Rhodes. Nat sighs exhausted, and sits down, as she notices Rhodes still online in the call.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you?

RHODEY: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's probably a rival gang.

RHODEY: Except it isn't. (Nat realizes something.) It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... (Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.) I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.

(In an abrupt moment of silence, she tries to chew her tears and emotional feelings as she eats a sandwich.)

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Will you find out where he's going next?

RHODEY: Nat...

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Please.

RHODEY: [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]

[Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.]

STEVE ROGERS: You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already.

[Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: You here to do your laundry?

STEVE ROGERS: And to see a friend.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Clearly, your friend is fine.

STEVE ROGERS: You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: In the Hudson?

STEVE ROGERS: There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]

STEVE ROGERS: Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]

STEVE ROGERS: You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: If I move on, who does this?

STEVE ROGERS: Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.

STEVE ROGERS: I think we both need to get a life.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling] You first.

[A camera footage pops up in front of them, showing Scott Lang with his Quantum Realm Van behind him.]

Scott Lang: Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.

STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Is this an old message?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Also standing up] It's the front gate.

SCOTT LANG: Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.

[Cut to Scott inside the Avengers Compound, pacing worriedly in front of Steve and Natasha.]

STEVE ROGERS: Scott. Are you okay?

SCOTT LANG: Yeah. I'm fine.

[He struggles to ask about something. He finally blurts it out.]

SCOTT LANG: Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Only to make conversation.

SCOTT LANG: Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.

SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours.

[Steve and Nat share a quick bewildered glance.]

SCOTT LANG: See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

[He strides over to pick up Nat's sandwich, and bites into it.]

STEVE ROGERS: Scott, what are you talking about?

SCOTT LANG: What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.

STEVE ROGERS: Wait, are you talking about a time machine?

SCOTT LANG: No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

SCOTT LANG: So who do we talk to about this?

[We cut to a cabin in the woods, at the bank of a lake. We see Tony Stark sitting outside what looks like a tiny shed.] TONY STARK: [Clapping his hand in a famous beat. Clap! Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap- Clap!] Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?

MORGAN STARK: Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's]

(A girl with long dark hair walks out in front of Tony. This is Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter. She looks to be about 3 & 4 years of age.)

TONY STARK: Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)

MORGAN STARK: Okay.

TONY STARK: There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

MORGAN STARK: No.

TONY STARK: That's what you want. How did you find this?

MORGAN STARK: Garage.

TONY STARK: Really? Were you looking for it?

MORGAN STARK: No. I found it, though.

TONY STARK: You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.

(They start walking towards the house, but Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.)

SCOTT LANG: (Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony) Now, we know what it sounds like...

STEVE ROGERS: Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?

TONY STARK: Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?

(Scott, Steve and Nat all look puzzled. Science is barely any of their fields.)

STEVE ROGERS: (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.

TONY STARK: In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

SCOTT LANG: I did.

TONY STARK: No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?

SCOTT LANG: (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?

TONY STARK: Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?

SCOTT LANG: The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.

TONY STARK: Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

STEVE ROGERS: I don't believe we would.

TONY STARK: Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.

SCOTT LANG: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -

TONY STARK: I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?

SCOTT LANG: [embarrassed] No.

TONY STARK: Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Tony... We have to take a stand.

TONY STARK: We did stand. And yet, here we are.

SCOTT LANG: I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...

TONY STARK: That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.

[Morgan runs to her dad, who picks her up.]

MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.

TONY STARK: Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.

STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance. TONY STARK: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

[We see Cap, Nat and Scott walking back to their car outside Tony's house.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's scared.

STEVE ROGERS: He's not wrong.

SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

STEVE ROGERS: No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.

SCOTT LANG: (Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house) Bigger than his?

[Cut to a cafe somewhere, we see Bruce Banner, but not the same one that we remember. He looks more... Professor Smart Hulk.]

BRUCE BANNER: Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs.

SCOTT LANG: I'm so confused.

BRUCE BANNER: [seriously] These are confusing times.

SCOTT LANG: Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.

BRUCE BANNER: [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.

SCOTT LANG: Yeah! Wh...How? Why?

BRUCE BANNER: Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: No one blamed you, Bruce.

BRUCE BANNER: I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...

[Three children behind Bruce walk up to him tentatively]

GIRL: Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?

BRUCE BANNER: Yes?

GIRL: Can we get a photo?

BRUCE BANNER: 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?

SCOTT LANG: Oh, yeah.

BRUCE BANNER: Thanks, [To the Children] Say "green"! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]

BRUCE BANNER: Did you get that?

SCOTT LANG: [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

SCOTT LANG: They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.

BRUCE BANNER: Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]

BOY: Stranger Danger.

SCOTT LANG: He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.

BRUCE BANNER: But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...

SCOTT LANG: I don't want a picture with them.

BRUCE BANNER: [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.

SCOTT LANG: I don't want it anymore.

BRUCE BANNER: No, no...you feel bad.

SCOTT LANG: Just take the goddamn phone. [Maybe next time, Scott.]

GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

BRUCE BANNER: No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. [Same time with kids] Hulk out!

STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.

BRUCE BANNER: [Awkwardly] Dab!

STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.

BRUCE BANNER: Listen to your Mom. She knows better.

STEVE ROGERS: About we were saying...

BRUCE BANNER: Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.

[The scene cuts to Tony Stark in the kitchen washing dishes after dinner. As he finishes the last of them, stumbles upon a photo of both Stark and Parker, with Parker holding his Stark Internship certificate. Tony finally knows what he's fighting for.]

[Cut to Tony talking to his computer, generating a holographic model of something he's working on.]

TONY STARK: Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Processing...

TONY STARK: Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Just a moment.

TONY STARK: And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Model rendered.

[In a complete shock of amazement, the render comes back as 99.987% successful. Tony falls back, bewildered by this discovery.]

TONY STARK: Shit!

MORGAN STARK: Shit.

[Morgan, who has been hiding behind him all this time, giggles as she repeats the word Tony just uttered.]

TONY STARK: [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?

MORGAN STARK: Shit.

TONY STARK: No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.

MORGAN STARK: Why you up?

TONY STARK: 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.

MORGAN STARK: Was it Juice Pops?

TONY STARK: Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... [Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind.

[In Morgan's room]

TONY STARK: You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wipes Morgan's lips and pushes her head onto her pillow] That face goes there.

MORGAN STARK: Tell me a story.

TONY STARK: A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

MORGAN STARK: [Giggling] That's a horrible story.

TONY STARK: Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]

MORGAN STARK: I love you 3000.

TONY STARK: [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That's crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.

[Cut to the living room where Pepper is reading a book sitting on the couch. Tony paces in front of the fireplace.]

TONY STARK: Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]

TONY STARK: [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?

PEPPER POTTS: Oh, it's just a book on composting.

TONY STARK: [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?

PEPPER POTTS: Just -

TONY STARK: I figured it out, by the way.

PEPPER POTTS: You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -

TONY STARK: Time travel.

PEPPER POTTS: [Amazed] What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.

TONY STARK: That's right.

PEPPER POTTS: We got really lucky.

TONY STARK: Yeah, I know.

PEPPER POTTS: A lot of people didn't.

TONY STARK: No, I can't help everybody.

PEPPER POTTS: It sort a seems like you can.

TONY STARK: Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.

PEPPER POTTS: Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life. [Tony smiles]

TONY STARK: I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.

PEPPER POTTS: But would you be able to rest?

[Cut to a lab in the Avengers Compound, we see Bruce fiddling with buttons on a panel. Scott is in his Ant-Man costume in front of his van, with the back open to show the Quantum Tunnel. Nat and Steve are beside Bruce]

BRUCE BANNER: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.

[Scott opens the portal]

STEVE ROGERS: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.

BRUCE BANNER: Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]

SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that!

BRUCE BANNER: Just... It was a bad joke.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: You were kidding, right?

BRUCE BANNER: [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?

SCOTT LANG: Perfectly not confusing.

STEVE ROGERS: Good luck, Scott. You got this.

SCOTT LANG: You're right. I do, Captain America.

[Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel.]

BRUCE BANNER: On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!

[Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-Man suit comes back. A teenager in appears out of it.]

TEEN SCOTT LANG: Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right.

STEVE ROGERS: What is this?

BRUCE BANNER: What's going on?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: That...who is that?

[He pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem.]

BRUCE BANNER: Hold on. [Panicking]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that Scott?

TEEN SCOTT LANG: Yes, it's Scott!

[Teen Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit.]

OLD SCOTT LANG: Ow! My back!

STEVE ROGERS: What is this?

BRUCE BANNER: Can I get a little space here.

STEVE ROGERS: Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?

BRUCE BANNER: I'm working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]

[After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it's a baby in the Ant-Man suit.]

STEVE ROGERS: It's a baby. [seriously?]

BRUCE BANNER: It's Scott.

STEVE ROGERS: As a baby!

BRUCE BANNER: He'll grow.

STEVE ROGERS: Bring Scott back!

BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]

BRUCE BANNER: And... Kill it!

[Nat pulls down a lever, and everything shuts down. Scott, the normal Scott, gets spewed back out again.]

SCOTT LANG: Somebody peed my pants.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh thank god.

SCOTT LANG: But I don't know if it was "baby" me or "old" me...Or just "me" me.

BRUCE BANNER: [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!

[Steve says nothing. He simply shakes his head and walks away]

BRUCE BANNER: What? I..I see this as an absolute win!

[We cut to see Steve sitting outside the Avengers Compound, staring at the floor, deep in thought. He looks beat, the only possibility of victory now not an opportunity. He looks up as a deafening noise breaks the silence in the distance. As he looks, we see an Audi R8 speeding towards the entrance. The car pulls over to Cap, but goes a bit too far, then reverses to Cap. We see Tony Stark roll down the window and look at Cap.]

TONY STARK: Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.

STEVE ROGERS: Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

[He gets out of the car, and walks around to the back.]

TONY STARK: [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.

STEVE ROGERS: You did.

TONY STARK: Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there's the Tony we know] Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

STEVE ROGERS: Me too.

TONY STARK: We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.

STEVE ROGERS: Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.]

[Tony reaches back into his trunk to pull something else out, Captain America's Shield. He makes to give it to Steve, who hesitates.]

STEVE ROGERS: Tony...

TONY STARK: Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

[Steve fits his arm into the shield.]

STEVE ROGERS: Thank you, Tony.

TONY STARK: Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?

STEVE ROGERS: We're working on that right now.

[Cut to the Benatar landing in the yard of the Avenger's Compound. Scott is sitting having a Taco and some Nachos at a bench, and everything falls out of the taco as the Benatar lands. Nebula and Rocket walk out of the ship, and past Scott.]

ROCKET: Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?

SCOTT LANG: Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome.

NEBULA: [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.

[She walks away. Moments later, just as Scott is getting back to his senses, Rhodey lands right in front of him without warning. This time Scott is so surprised, he drops the whole taco.]

SCOTT LANG: Oh, God!

RHODEY: What's up, regular sized man?

[As Rhodey walks away, Bruce walks out of the Compound. Seeing that Scott dropped his lunch, he hands two tacos from his own lunch to Scott. Scott takes it while giving Bruce a puzzling look at this act of kindness.]

[Song "My Supersonic Ship" plays in the background. Cut to Bruce sitting at the back of a Utility car as they traverse the green countryside of Norway. They pass a sign labelled "WELCOME TO NEW ASGARD, PLEASE DRIVE SLOWLY.". They stop at a small town on a port. Bruce and Rocket get out of the car, and look around at the remaining Asgardians, living like normal humans at a port.]

ROCKET: Kind of a step down from a golden palace and magic hammers and whatnot.

BRUCE BANNER: Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]

VALKYRIE: You shouldn't have come!

BRUCE BANNER: Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.

VALKYRIE: [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.

ROCKET: How you doin'?

VALKYRIE: [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.

BRUCE BANNER: That bad, huh?

VALKYRIE: We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies.

BRUCE BANNER: It's that bad.

VALKYRIE: Yeah.

[Cut to Rocket opening a door, and him and Bruce walking through it.]

ROCKET: [Grimacing at the smell] What the... Woo! Something died in here.

BRUCE BANNER: Hello? Thor?

THOR: [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?

[He walks into view, and the audience's jaw drops. Thor, who is shirtless, has definitely put on more than a couple of pounds since we saw him last.]

THOR: The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]

BRUCE BANNER: Thor?

THOR: [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! [growling]

ROCKET: No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.

THOR: Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?

[We see Miek and Korg sitting on a couch, PlayStation controller in hand, playing Fortnite and eating chips.]

KORG: Hey boys!

BRUCE BANNER: Hey guys, long time no see.

KORG: Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.

THOR: NoobMaster.

KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

[Thor walks over to Korg, takes his headphones, and speaks into the mic.]

THOR: NoobMaster. Hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms and SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT! Oh, that's right, go cry to your father, you little weasel!

KORG: [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor.

THOR: Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

KORG: Thank you very much. I will.

THOR: So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

[Thor uses Stormbreaker to open a bottle of beer and starts drinking. Bruce walks to him and places a hand on his shoulder]

BRUCE BANNER: Buddy, you all right?

THOR: Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?

ROCKET: [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.

THOR: [Laughs] So, what's up?

BRUCE BANNER: We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.

THOR: What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

BRUCE BANNER: Like Thanos.

[Thor's smile slowly disappears. He puts a shaky hand on Bruce's shoulder and points at him.]

THOR: Don't say that name.

[Korg stands up and takes off his headphones]

KORG: Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.

BRUCE BANNER: [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you.

THOR: Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.

[Thor walks off screen]

KORG: Umm... Stormbreaker?

THOR: Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?

BRUCE BANNER: I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?

THOR: I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

BRUCE BANNER: It was you. You helped me.

THOR: [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway.

BRUCE BANNER: I think we can bring them back.

THOR: Stop. stop, okay? [opens a packet on M&Ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we? [The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more]

KORG: Nah, all good here, mate.

[Cuts back to Thor]

THOR: So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.

BRUCE BANNER: [from offscreen] We need you, pal.

[Thor shakes his head and ignores Bruce.]

ROCKET: [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.

THOR: [pauses, but doesn't look up then puts the bottle down] What kind?

[SCREEN TITLE: TOKYO]

[After seeing a Quinjet flown to the capital, the scene cuts to a nightclub in the city of Tokyo, as the entertainment still intact, loads of dead bodies of yakuza members are seen as a hooded figure throws a shuriken at another yakuza member firing at him. They are shouting something in Japanese, as two more men come out of nowhere and draw out their UZIs.]

THUG #1: あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！(Romanized: Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It's him! He's after Akihiko!)

[Both thugs fire their SMGs as both got slain by a shuriken. A yakuza member wielding a katana charges at him in the stairs, but is immediately overthrown and slain by the Ronin. Ronin then fights another sword-wielding thug, which is thrown outside the glass, killing him. The camera passes through two more buildings as the fighting ensues with different screams, shouts, more havoc inside, and gunfire. A man in a dark raincoat jumps through the glass window, with the Ronin doing the same, as both of them lands in a dark alleyway. The man in the raincoat turns to the Ronin, who just landed after him. It was Akihiko, the leader of a yakuza gang, whose head being hunted by the Ronin himself.]

AKIHIKO: てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！(Romanized: Temē naze konna koto wo suru? Oretachi temē ni nani mo shitenē daro!) (English: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!)

RONIN: [As he draws out his katana and reversibly wields it.]地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…(Romanized: Chikyū no hanbun sanosu ni yarareta... Omae wa naze buji nano...) (English: You survived... Half of the planet didn't. They got Thanos... you get me.)

[Both sides engaged in combat as Ronin pierces his stomach, but doing only minor damage to him.]

RONIN: [Also in Japanese] お前はもう十分殺しただろ(Romanized:Omae mo jūbun korshita daro) You're done hurting people.

AKIHIKO: [Japanese]俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen and chuckles] (English: WE hurt people? You're crazy!)

[Akihiko charges, which Ronin immediately blocks. Both clang swords for two seconds, seeming that the yakuza leader has the upper hand, but Ronin punches him in the face, and sword-points him to his throat, in which Akihiko is temporarily petrified.]

[He lowers down his sword as if he is about to surrender, but charges again at Ronin. Both swords clashed as Ronin slices his stomach, losing stamina, but gaining more strength from his rage.]

AKIHIKO: [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] 死ね! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)

[They both draw their katanas and the sword-fight continues. Ronin is clearly a better fighter, but Akihiko is also quite experienced. They clang swords, and for a second, it looks like Akihiko has the upper hand swinging at Ronin's neck. Ronin, however, ducks and slides under the katana, and slices Akihiko in the stomach as he slides past. Akihiko, now fatally injured, drops his katana.]

AKIHIKO: 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? (Romanized: Mate! Tasukete kure! Omae ni nan demo yaru! Nani ga hosī? (English: Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want?)

RONIN: [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me.

[He thrusts the blade downwards into Akihiko's stomach. The body of the Japanese falls to the ground. Ronin grabs the sword, and wipes it on his gauntlet, ridding it of the blood of Akihiko. He notices someone behind him, and grabs his mask, and slides it off his head, revealing himself as Clint Barton, who has gone on a rampage since the decimation. He turns around and looks at Nat, who is standing behind him, holding an umbrella, and in casual clothes.]

CLINT BARTON: You shouldn't be here.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Neither should you.

CLINT BARTON: I've got a job to do.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

[Clint starts to look emotional, on the verge of crying.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: We found something. A chance, maybe...

CLINT BARTON: [Now openly crying] Don't...

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Don't what?

CLINT BARTON: ...don't give me hope.

NATASHA: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

[We cut to the Avenger's Compound, where we see Thor in a hoodie, drinking a beer and walking through the compound's Testing Chamber. Tony is also there, walking in from behind Thor.]

TONY STARK: [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How's it going?

ROCKET: It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

[Cut to a side room, where we see Scott, Bruce, Steve and Rhodey talking. Scott is in a white and red suit, similar to the Ant-Man suit.]

RHODEY: Time travel suit? Not bad.

SCOTT LANG: [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!

BRUCE BANNER: I'm being very careful.

SCOTT LANG: No, you're being very Hulky.

BRUCE BANNER: I'm being careful.

SCOTT LANG: [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.

RHODEY: Scott, calm down.

SCOTT LANG: Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run.

[Cut to the testing chamber, where we see Steve, Nat, Tony, Scott, Bruce, Rhodey and Nebula standing at a control panel, presumably controlling the glass platform.]

SCOTT LANG: All right. I'm not ready for this.

CLINT BARTON: I'm game. I'll do it.

[Clint walks in wearing the suit Scott was moments before, the Quantum Suit.]

BRUCE BANNER: Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it.

[Clint taking position on the platform]

RHODEY: Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]

BRUCE BANNER: [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible...

RHODEY: [In a tone that says it's what we're all thinking.] It's Thanos.

BRUCE BANNER: ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.

SCOTT LANG: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

CLINT BARTON: Bingo.

NEBULA: That's not how it works.

CLINT BARTON: Well, that's what I heard.

BRUCE BANNER: What? By who? Who told you that?

RHODEY: [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -

SCOTT LANG: Quantum Leap -

RHODEY: A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -

SCOTT LANG: Hot Tub Time Machine -

RHODEY: Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

SCOTT LANG: Die Hard? No, it's not one...

RHODEY: This is known.

BRUCE BANNER: I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...

NEBULA: Exactly.

SCOTT LANG: So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?

BRUCE BANNER: [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!

[A helmet similar to Ant-Man's but white and more visible face pops on Clint's head, and he goes quantum. Clint flies through the quantum realm and into an opening. He grows back to normal size, but he's at a different place, and seemingly, time.]

[Clint look around his family home, which unlike at the start of the movie, looks a lot more alive. The helmet pops off of Clint's head, and he looks around bewildered. He sees a baseball glove on the ground, presumably belonging to one of his sons, and picks it up. We hear a noise from inside the house, someone who Clint hasn't seen for five years.]

LILA BARTON: [offscreen] Cooper? Where are my headphones?

CLINT BARTON: [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]

[We hear footsteps coming towards where Clint has just disappeared, and we see Lila coming down the stairs in Avril Lavigne-like clothing, looking around, puzzled]

LILA BARTON: Yeah, Dad? [She looks around] Dad?

[Lila goes back upstairs, deciding that it was just nothing]

[Cut to the Avengers Compound, we see Clint rematerialise on the glass platform, breathing heavily and sitting on the platform.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

CLINT BARTON: [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked.

[Scene cuts to the Avengers in a room with some hologram displays, showcasing each of the six Infinity Stones, sitting around a table. Tony, Steve and Bruce are pacing at the front, clearly leading the planning of the mission.]

STEVE ROGERS: Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

TONY STARK: Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.

SCOTT LANG: I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

BRUCE BANNER: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

TONY STARK: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.

CLINT BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets.

TONY STARK: Correct.

STEVE ROGERS: Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?

[We see Thor sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on. It is impossible to tell whether he is awake or asleep.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is he asleep?

RHODEY: No, I'm pretty sure he's dead.

[Thor wakes up]

THOR: Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.

TONY STARK: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

THOR: I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you.

[Cut to the Avengers sitting around a table, eating a meal, and Rocket is pacing on the table in front of everyone.]

ROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

SCOTT LANG: Is that a person?

ROCKET: Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.

SCOTT LANG: A planet? Like in outer space?

ROCKET: Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space.

[Cut to everyone facing Nebula in the planning room, and Nat writing notes for their plan.]

NEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?

NEBULA: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister.

[Nat looks up, and an awkward silence falls upon the room. She writes what Nebula has just said, and Scott makes to break the awkward moment.]

SCOTT LANG: Not it.

[We see Tony and Nat lying on a table surrounded by papers, and Bruce lying down on the floor. The Time Stone pops up on the display.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: That Time Stone guy...

BRUCE BANNER: Doctor Strange.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

TONY STARK: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.

BRUCE BANNER: Nice place in the village, though.

TONY STARK: Yeah. Sullivan Street.

BRUCE BANNER: Hmm... Bleecker.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Wait, he lived in New York?

TONY STARK: No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.

BRUCE BANNER: [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.

[Shot cuts to the holograms displaying the different location, the Soul and Power Stones in space in 2014. the Reality Stone in Asgard, 2013; and the Space, Mind, and Time Stones in New York City, 2012]

STEVE ROGERS: All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.

[He and the other Avengers walk up and look at the screens determinedly. The shot cuts to the Avengers walking in a file to the Quantum Time machine, wearing the Quantum Suits, albeit with some minor differences for different people. Rhodey has a bulkier repaint of the War machine armour.]

STEVE ROGERS: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck.

ROCKET:[Refers to Steve's speaking] He's pretty good at that.

SCOTT LANG: Right? [Looks very excited]

TONY STARK: All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.

BRUCE BANNER: Tractors engaged.

ROCKET: [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?

CLINT BARTON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best.

ROCKET: As promises go, that was pretty lame.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.

[They all shrink and enter the Quantum Realm, and they all split at different intervals, going to a different place at a different time in history.]

[The First Group which has Tony, Steve, Bruce, & Scott; travels to New York in 2012. A previous stock shot of the Chitauri snarling and the iconic circle take around our six Original Avengers assembling before panning over to a side street where Scott, Steve, Banner and Tony materialise.]

STEVE ROGERS: All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

[2012 Hulk passes by them, smashing everything in his way. Bruce puts his hand on his face, embarrassed.] STEVE ROGERS: Feel free to smash a few things along the way.

BRUCE BANNER: I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

[Present Bruce pretends to smash things in a sarcastic way. He tears his shirt off, and walks over to a car. He lightly punches the car, making a small dent, all the while making growling noises. He picks up a motorbike and throws it at a wall, wincing as it hits the wall.]

[Shot cuts to the Roof of the Sanctum Sanctorum where 2012 The Ancient One protects it. Bruce tries to enter through the roof before noticing her.]

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.

BRUCE BANNER: I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?

BRUCE BANNER: That, actually.

[He points towards the Eye of Agamotto where the Time Stone is kept. The Ancient One (2012) looks at it]

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Ah! I'm afraid not.

BRUCE BANNER: Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You don't wanna do this.

BRUCE BANNER: Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-

[The Ancient One (2012) pushes Bruce's astral form out of his body. Bruce who's is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.]

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Let's start over, shall we?

[Cut to an aerial shot of Asgard in 2013.Then to the prison in Asgard, where we see the Loki from The Dark World, sitting in his cell. Without him noticing, Rocket and Thor creep by, past the cell. They stop at a pillar a few metres away room of where Jane Foster is]

THOR: That's Jane.

ROCKET: All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.

THOR: I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups...

ROCKET: Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

[A door opens, Thor and Rocket both try to hide. We then see ladies along with Frigga (2013) walking. Thor sees his mother.]

ROCKET: Who's the fancy broad?

THOR: It's my Mother. She dies today.

ROCKET: Oh. That's today?

THOR: I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.

ROCKET: Come here. [Standing in front of him]

THOR: No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-

ROCKET: Come here. Right here.

[Rocket slaps Thor in the face.]

ROCKET: You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?

THOR: Okay.

ROCKET: Are you crying?

THOR: No...Yes!

ROCKET: Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?

THOR: Yes, I can.

ROCKET: Good.

THOR: I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this.

[Thor runs away.]

ROCKET: Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!

[Cut to Morag in 2014, where we see Rhodey getting off the Benatar as it lands.]

RHODEY: Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

CLINT BARTON: Hey, can we hurry it up?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock.

[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.

RHODEY: All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah.

RHODEY: Take that stone and come back. No messing around.

CLINT BARTON: [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.

RHODEY: Let's get it done. Yes, sir.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.

RHODEY: You guys watch each other's six.

[Clint and Nat look back and just smile.]

CLINT BARTON: Yeah.

[They walk back into the ship, and the hatch closes. The ship takes off and speeds out of the atmosphere of Morag.]

NEBULA: The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.

[In the Benatar, Clint and Nat are sitting at the front of the ship. The ship takes a jump through space and speeds up tremendously. Nat and Clint look at each other.]

CLINT BARTON: It's a long way from Budapest.

[Natasha just laughs. Back to Morag, where Rhodey and Nebula are standing where we left them.]

RHODEY: Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

NEBULA: [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

RHODEY: Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?

NEBULA: My father, my sister... and me.

RHODEY: And you? Where are you right now?

[Cuts to a scene of Gamora (2014) and Nebula (2014) fighting some Korbinite soldiers.]

GAMORA (2014): [Helping Nebula up] You're welcome.

NEBULA (2014): I didn't ask for your help.

GAMORA (2014): And yet, you always need it. [Nebula (2014) laughs and Gamora's hand.] Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

NEBULA (2014): Why?

GAMORA (2014): He's found an Infinity Stone.

NEBULA (2014): Where?

GAMORA (2014): On a planet called Morag.

NEBULA (2014): Father's plan is finally in motion.

GAMORA (2014): One stone isn't six, Nebula.

NEBULA (2014): It’s a start.

GAMORA (2014): If he gets all of them...

[Thanos (2014) arrives, honking badass double-bladed sword in tow and healthy coating blood of his armour.]

THANOS (2014): Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.

GAMORA (2014): He won't like that.

THANOS (2014): His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.

NEBULA (2014): We will not fail you, Father.

[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]

THANOS (2014): No, you won't.

NEBULA (2014): I swear...I will make you proud.

[Nebula (2014) is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula's memories.]

RHODEY (Memory): We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

NEBULA (Memory): Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

[Nebula (2014) shuts off the memory]

GAMORA (2014): Who was that?

NEBULA (2014): I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...

GAMORA (2014): Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

[Thanos walks towards Nebula and brings his blade to her throat.]

THANOS (2014): Shhh... (pointing to Nebula) Bring her to my ship.

[Cut to present Tony Stark flying around Stark Tower in the Mark 85. He scans the interior of the tower, and sees the original Avengers apprehending Loki, the backside of the iconic shot of Hawkeye pointing the bow at Loki's face while the Avengers surround him.]

TONY STARK: Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. [Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.]

STEVE ROGERS: Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

LOKI (2012): If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.

TONY STARK (2012): All right, get him on his feet. We can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up.

TONY STARK: Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass.

STEVE ROGERS: No one asked you to look, Tony.

TONY STARK: [whispers] It's ridiculous.

SCOTT LANG: I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

TONY STARK (2012): STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

[A Hydra team including Rumlow and Sitwell enter, known at this time as a part of SHIELD.]

SITWELL (2012): We can take that [Taking Loki's Scepter from 2012 Natasha] off your hands.

NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): By all means. Careful with that thing.

CLINT BARTON (2012): Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.

SITWELL (2012): We promise to be careful.

SCOTT LANG: Who are these guys?

TONY STARK: They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.

SCOTT LANG: Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys.

TONY STARK: You're small, but you're talking loud.

STEVE ROGERS (2012): On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

LOKI (2012): [Transforming into Steve for a second in imitation] On my way down to coordinate search and rescue! [Transforming back] I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be...

THOR (2012): [Slapping on a device on Loki's mouth to make him quiet] Shut up.

TONY STARK: All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone.

SCOTT LANG: [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me.

[Tony flicks Scott onto his 2012 self, right into his beard. 2012 Tony then scratches his beard, dropping present Scott onto 2012 Tony's reactor.]

[All of the 2012 Avengers get in an elevator. Hulk makes to follow, but finds the elevator full.]

HULK (2012): Move.

THOR (2012): Whoa!

TONY STARK (2012): Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

THOR (2012): Take the stairs.

TONY STARK (2012): Yeah. [Hulk draws his fist back right as the elevator door closes] Stop. Stop!

[He follows through with the punch, making a dent in the wall right where the door was.]

HULK (2012): [Pissed] Take the stairs! Hate the stairs!

TONY STARK: All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.

STEVE ROGERS: On it. Head to the lobby.

TONY STARK: Alright. I'll see you there.

[scene cuts to HYDRA agents in the elevator]

SITWELL (2012): Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

[Elevator opens and HYDRA agents sees Steve. Steve walks in and hits the button to continue down.]

SITWELL (2012): Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?

STEVE ROGERS: Change of plans.

RUMLOW (2012): Hey, Cap.

STEVE ROGERS: Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

SITWELL (2012): Sir? I don't understand.

STEVE ROGERS: We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

RUMLOW (2012): Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter.

SITWELL (2012): I'm gonna have to call the Director.

STEVE ROGERS: That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear.] Hail Hydra.

[Everyone is surprised, Steve walks out of the elevator with the scepter and a smile. Cut to the building's stairwell. The Hulk looks down at the many stairs below him.]

HULK (2012): [Angrily] So many stairs!

[Cut to the lobby. The 2012 Avengers start to make their way out of the building. Tony and Scott eye them undercover.]

TONY STARK: Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.

SCOTT LANG: Bombs away. [Sliding down to Tony's Arc Reactor] Is... is that Axe body spray?

TONY STARK: Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?

SCOTT LANG: I'm going inside you. Now.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): May I ask you where you're going?

THOR (2012): To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?

TONY STARK (2012): Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

THOR (2012): Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years.

HYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark.

TONY STARK: [To present Scott through radio as he inhales sharply] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

TONY STARK(2012): I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?

SCOTT LANG: You promise me you won't die?

TONY STARK: You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

SCOTT LANG: That doesn't sound mild.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): I need the case.

TONY STARK (2012): I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Okay. Then give me the case.

TONY STARK: Do it, Lang!

TONY STARK (2012): Get your hands off!

TONY STARK: Window's closing. Pull my pin!

SCOTT LANG: Here goes!

[Ant-Man pulls off Stark 2012's reactor, and Tony (2012) drops the case]

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark?

THOR (2012): Stark!

[Stark 2012 falls down to the ground]

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!

TONY STARK: MEDIC! You guys, some help!

ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark, you--- your chest machine?

[Ant-Man pushes the case, Loki looks at case, Tony Stark grabs the case.]

TONY STARK: Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

[Suddenly, Hulk 2012 pushes Tony to the ground and the Tesseract slides to Loki]

HULK (2012): NO STAIRS!!!!

[Everyone runs from Hulk's rampage, Loki 2012 grabs the Tesseract and teleports it away.]

THOR (2012): You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work.

[Thor 2012 uses the Mjolnir as the defibrillator on Tony Stark 2012]

THOR (2012): YES!

TONY STARK (2012): That worked a treat. That was so crazy!

THOR (2012): I had no idea if that was gonna work.

TONY STARK (2012): The case?

THOR (2012): The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!

SCOTT LANG: That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

TONY STARK: Oh, we blew it.

THOR (2012): Loki!?

[Cut to a walkway several floors up. Steve is having trouble on his communicator.]

STEVE ROGERS: Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans.] Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

[In front of him, Steve sees his 2012 self looking back]

STEVE ROGERS (2012): I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

STEVE ROGERS: [Puts the case down] I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.

[2012 Steve engages and the two Captain Americas begin to duel.]

STEVE ROGERS (2012): I can do this all day.

STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Yeah, I know. I know.

[Both Rogers' frisbee their shield's at one another which clang away as they brawl, inadvertently kicking away the case containing the scepter which falls down a few levels. 2012 Steve gets the upper hand on Future Steve's as they both fall down to the same level as the scepter. Future Steve's locket of Peggy falls out, Steve (2012) notices it.]

STEVE ROGERS (2012): Where did you get this?

[Steve (2012) has future Steve in a chokehold]

STEVE ROGERS: Bucky... is... alive!

STEVE ROGERS (2012): What?

[Future Steve takes the chance to sucker punch his counterpart, grab the scepter and knock Steve (2012) out, gets up and stares at him]

STEVE ROGERS: That is America's ass.

[Scene cuts back to Bruce and The Ancient One (2012). As Hulk is lying down on a beach chair who looks like he's sleeping with a hat on, Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone.]

BRUCE BANNER: Please, please!

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.

BRUCE BANNER: With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.

[The Ancient One creates a projection with a long ray that simulates the flow of time.]

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [She flicks the Time Stone projection away and Shows black stream indicating a point of divergence] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?

BRUCE BANNER: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, [Holds the Time Stone projection] in that reality, [puts it back to its spot] it never left.

[Bruce's astral form takes the projection of the removed Time Stone, replaces it back amongst the other five, and the doomed alternate dimension fades away, illustrating his point.]

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [still not convinced.] But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

BRUCE BANNER: We will. I will. I promise.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

BRUCE BANNER: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [Surprised] What did you say?

BRUCE BANNER: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Willingly?

BRUCE BANNER: Yes!

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): ...Why?

BRUCE BANNER: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Or I did. [She returns to Banner control of his Hulk body and opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone] Strange is meant to be the best of us.

BRUCE BANNER: So he must have done it for a reason.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I fear you might be right. [gives him the Time Stone]

BRUCE BANNER: Thank you.

THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.

[Cut to Thanos (2014), Nebula (2014), Gamora (2014) and Ebony Maw (2014) on the Sanctuary II.]

THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.

EBONY MAW (2014): Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.

THANOS (2014): Impossible.

EBONY MAW (2014): This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.

THANOS (2014): Where is this other Nebula?

EBONY MAW (2014): In our solar system. On Morag.

THANOS (2014): Can you access her?

EBONY MAW (2014): Yes. The two are linked.

THANOS (2014): Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.

[Memory of the meeting with all the Avengers starts playing]

BRUCE BANNER (2023): And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.

TONY STARK (2023): Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.

CLINT BARTON (2023): Which means we have to pick our targets.

TONY STARK (2023): Correct.

[End memory.]

THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Freeze image.

GAMORA (2014): Terrans.

THANOS (2014): Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.

GAMORA (2014): [Looking at a reflection of Nebula (2023)] I don't understand. Two Nebulas.

THANOS (2014): No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.

[Cut back to Thor and Rocket in Asgard, 2013]

FRIGGA (2013): My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on.

[Thor tries not to get caught behind a large post, but gets shocked when he sees his mother behind him]

FRIGGA (2013): [To Thor] What are you doing?

THOR: Aah!!!

FRIGGA (2013): Aah!!!

THOR: OH, God!

FRIGGA (2013): You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

THOR: Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... [Trying to hide his belly]

FRIGGA (2013): What are you wearing?

THOR: I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.

[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him}

FRIGGA (2013): What's wrong with your eye?

THOR: Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?

FRIGGA (2013): You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

THOR: [Pretending] Yes, I am.

FRIGGA (2013): The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

THOR: I didn't say I'm from the future.

FRIGGA (2013): I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that.

[Thor attempts to hold back his tears and fails miserably.]

THOR: [voice breaking up] I am totally, totally from the future.

FRIGGA (2013): Yes, you are.

THOR: I really need to talk to you.

FRIGGA (2013): We can talk.

[They both hug each other. Scene cuts to Jane Foster waking up while Rocket sneaks behind her to extract the Aether. Scene cuts back to Thor and Frigga's conversation.]

THOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.

FRIGGA (2013): You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

THOR: I guess, yeah.

FRIGGA (2013): Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.

THOR: That's a little bit harsh.

FRIGGA (2013): You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.

THOR: I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

FRIGGA (2013): Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.

THOR: I really missed you, Mum.

[scene cuts to Rocket running away from the Asgardian soldiers]

ROCKET: Thor! I got it!

ASGARDIAN SOLDIER (2013): Get that rabbit!

THOR: Ma, I have to tell you something.

FRIGGA (2013): No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine.

THOR: But this is about your future.

FRIGGA (2013): It's none of my business. [does she know?]

ROCKET: Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move.

THOR: I wish we had more time.

FRIGGA (2013): No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.

THOR: I love you, Mom.

FRIGGA (2013): I love you. And eat a salad.

ROCKET: Come on. We gotta go.

FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.

ROCKET: Three... two...

THOR: No, wait!

[Thor holds out his hand]

ROCKET: [To Frigga] Wh- what am I looking at?

FRIGGA (2013): Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

[Thor summons Mjolnir.]

THOR: [Happy and a little bit surprised] I'm still worthy.

["Come And Get Your Love" starts playing in the background.]

ROCKET: Oh, boy.

THOR: Goodbye, Mom.

FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.

[Scene cuts to Quill on Morag dancing to "Come And Get Your Love", we then pan over to Rhodey and Nebula hiding in the background watching Quill dance and sing to their perspective without music.]

RHODEY: So he's an idiot?

NEBULA: Yeah.

[Rhodey knocks out Quill and Nebula rummages around to take Quill's tool.]

RHODEY: What's that?

NEBULA: The tool of a thief.

[Nebula uses the tool to open the door that leads to The Orb A.K.A The Power Stone. Nebula tries to walk in but is stopped by Rhodey.]

RHODEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything...

NEBULA: What are you talking about?

RHODEY: When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–

[Nebula just shakes her head and walks in.]

RHODEY: Okay. All right. Go ahead.

[Nebula forces her hand inside the force field protecting The Orb while it melts away the exterior plating on her arm. She successfully retrieves The Orb and hands it to Rhodey all the while Rhodey watched the whole thing happened.]

NEBULA: I wasn't always like this.

RHODEY: Me either. But we work with what we got, right?

[They just both look at each other solemnly.]

RHODEY: Sync up. [They both suit up.] Three.. two.. one...

[Rhodey is the only one who disappears while Nebula is left behind unable to move, then she riddled with pain on her head. She falls to the ground.]

[Sanctuary II. 2014 Nebula is being scanned in synch with her future self. A memory is played, coming from future Nebula's head.]

BRUCE (Memory): You murdered trillions!

THANOS (Memory): You should be grateful.

NATASHA (Memory): Where are the stones?

THANOS (Memory): Gone. Reduced to atoms.

BRUCE (Memory): You used them two days ago.

THANOS (Memory): I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.

[Memory pauses.]

GAMORA (2014): What did you do to them?

THANOS (2014): Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

GAMORA (2014): The stones...

THANOS (2014): I found them all. I won. Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

[Thanos (2014) caress Gamora (2014) and she kneels down]

EBONY MAW (2014): This is your future.

THANOS (2014): It's my destiny.

[Maw resumes playing the memory]

NEBULA (Memory): My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.

THANOS (Memory): Ah...Thank you, Daughter. Perhaps I treated you too harshly...

[Thanos gets beheaded in the memory, Gamora (2014) is shocked and stands up]

THANOS (2014): And that, is destiny fulfilled.

EBONY MAW (2014): [Dangerous voice.] Sire, your Daughter...

[Maw (2014) telekinetically wraps a chain around Nebula (2014).]

NEBULA (2014): No!

EBONY MAW (2014): ...is a traitor.

NEBULA (2014): That's not me. It's not. I could never... I would never betray you. Never.

[Thanos (2014) releases the chain around Nebula (2014) neck and holds her head in his palm]

THANOS (2014): I know. And you'll have the chance to prove it.

[Thanos (2014) makes sure Nebula cannot travel back to 2023. Nebula is stuck in 2014.]

NEBULA: No! He knows! [Runs back to the ship and gets on the comms.] Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows.

[Nebula looks up in horror just to be abducted by the Sanctuary II. The scene cuts to Steve, who has just defeated himself, jumping down from a building with the scepter]

TONY STARK: Cap–

[He turns around to see Tony and Scott sitting in a broken car.]

TONY STARK: Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem.

SCOTT LANG: Huh. Yeah, we do.

STEVE ROGERS: Well, what are we gonna do now?

TONY STARK: You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

SCOTT LANG: You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–

TONY STARK: You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.

SCOTT LANG: You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.

TONY STARK: Dude, come on.

SCOTT LANG: You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–

TONY STARK: I dropped the ball.

SCOTT LANG: You ruined the time heist.

TONY STARK: Is that what I did?

SCOTT LANG: Yeah!

STEVE ROGERS: Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

SCOTT LANG: No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home.

STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either.

TONY STARK: I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.

STEVE ROGERS: When were they both there?

TONY STARK: They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.

STEVE ROGERS: How vague?

SCOTT LANG: What are you talking about? Where are we going?

TONY STARK: I know for a fact they were there–

SCOTT LANG: Who's they? What are we doing?

TONY STARK: And I know how I know.

SCOTT LANG: Guys, what's up? What is it?

TONY STARK: Well, it looks like we're improvising.

SCOTT LANG: Right. What are we improvising?

TONY STARK: Scott, get this back to the compound.

TONY STARK: Suit up.

SCOTT LANG: What's in New Jersey?

TONY STARK: 0-4,

STEVE ROGERS: 0-4– -

TONY STARK: Uhh, 0-7.

STEVE ROGERS: 0-7. -

SCOTT LANG: Excuse me...

TONY STARK: 1-9-7-0.

STEVE ROGERS: Are you sure?

SCOTT LANG: Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back.

TONY STARK: Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. [To Steve] Do you trust me?

STEVE ROGERS: I do.

TONY STARK: Your call.

STEVE ROGERS: Here we go.

[Cut to Steve and Tony in New Jersey, 1970]

OUR WATCHER INFORMANT, STAN LEE (1922-2018 R.I.P): [Driving past Steve and Tony] Hey, man! Make love, not war!

TONY STARK: Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?

STEVE ROGERS: The idea of me was.

TONY STARK: Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?

STEVE ROGERS: In plain sight.

[Tony and Steve are in an elevator with a lady]

TONY STARK: [Leaving the elevator] Good luck on your mission, Captain.

STEVE ROGERS: [Waiting for another floor] Good luck on your project, doctor.

ELEVATOR LADY: You're new here?

STEVE ROGERS: Not exactly.

[Cut to Tony in what seems to be a lab area and he is looking for the tesseract]

TONY STARK: [Grabbing Tesseract] Gotcha. Back in the game.

HOWARD STARK: Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal.

TONY STARK: Oh, yeah.

HOWARD STARK: I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?

TONY STARK: Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul. [awkwardly bumps into a chair] Pardon me.

HOWARD STARK: Do I know you?

TONY STARK: No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT.

HOWARD STARK: Huh. MIT. Got a name?

TONY STARK: Uh– Howard.

HOWARD STARK: Well, that'll be easy to remember.

TONY STARK: Howard– Potts.

HOWARD STARK: Well, I'm Howard Stark. [Holds out hand to shake.]

TONY STARK: Hi. [Holds Howard's finger]

HOWARD STARK: Shake it, don't pull it.

TONY STARK: Yeah–

HOWARD STARK: You look a little green around the gills there, Potts.

TONY STARK: I'm fine. Just, long hours.

HOWARD STARK: Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts.

TONY STARK: Yeah. That would be swell.

HOWARD STARK: That way.

TONY STARK: Okay.

HOWARD STARK: Need your briefcase?

[Tony grabs the case]

HOWARD STARK: You're not one of those beatniks, are ya, Potts?

[Cut to a younger Hank Pym in his laboratory.]

CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Hello. Dr. Pym?

HANK PYM: That would be the number that you called. Yes.

CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): This is Captain Stevens from shipping. We have a package for you.

HANK PYM: Bring it up.

CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Well, that's the thing, sir. We can't.

HANK PYM: I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Well, it's just– Sir, the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

HANK PYM: They didn't open it, did they?

CAPTAIN STEVENS (STEVE ROGERS): Yeah, they did. You better get down here.

[We then see Pym running down a hallway]

HANK PYM: Excuse me! Out of the way!

[cut back to Howard and Tony]

TONY STARK: So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

HOWARD STARK: My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too much time in the office.

TONY STARK: Congratulations.

HOWARD STARK: Thanks. Hold this, will you?

TONY STARK: Yeah, sure. How far along is she?

HOWARD STARK: I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

TONY STARK: I have a little girl.

HOWARD STARK: A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

TONY STARK: What'd be so awful about that?

HOWARD STARK: Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.

[cut to elevator lady talking to security guards about Tony and Captain America looking fishy]

SECURITY OFFICER: And you've never seen these two men before?

ELEVATOR LADY: No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

SECURITY OFFICER: Can you describe them?

ELEVATOR LADY: Well, one of them had a hippie beard.

SECURITY OFFICER: Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

ELEVATOR LADY: Definitely Mungo Jerry.

SECURITY OFFICER: Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach.

[Steve walks into a room. Feeling safe, he suddenly see's a picture of himself. Then he's surprised to see his love Margret Carter. Cut to Tony and Howard still talking to each other.]

TONY STARK: So, where are you at with names?

HOWARD STARK: Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

TONY STARK: Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time.

HOWARD STARK: Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?

TONY STARK: Wildly. Yeah.

HOWARD STARK: Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?

TONY STARK: I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–

HOWARD STARK: My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

TONY STARK: I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.

HOWARD STARK: Yeah? Like what?

TONY STARK: "No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

HOWARD STARK: Smart guy.

TONY STARK: He did his best.

HOWARD STARK: Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts.

TONY STARK: Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country.

HOWARD STARK: Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?

EDWIN JARVIS: You meet a lot of people, sir.

HOWARD STARK: Seems very familiar. Weird beard.

[2014 Nebula has captured 2023 Nebula and 2014 Nebula is fighting her future self.]

NEBULA (2014): You're weak.

NEBULA: I'm you.

[Nebula (2014) throws a punch straight at Present Nebula. Gamora (2014) walks into the room.]

NEBULA: You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know how he does that? You wanna know what he does to you?

NEBULA (2014): That's enough. [kicks Present Nebula to the wall and pulls out her Electric Knife.] You disgust me. But that doesn't mean you're useless.

[Nebula (2014) steals the golden plate on the side of Present Nebula´s face and wears it herself. Then she walks up to Thanos, gives him a Pym Particle and shows him her new look.]

NEBULA (2014): How do I look?

[Scene cuts to Vormir 2014 where Natasha and Clint arrives.]

CLINT BARTON: Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.

[Natasha and Clint starts walking towards the mountain and climb it.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. CLINT BARTON: Technically, he's not a raccoon, you know.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever. He eats garbage.

RED SKULL (2014): Welcome.

[Natasha and Clint draws their weapons.]

RED SKULL (2014): Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Who are you?

RED SKULL (2014): Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh, good. You tell us where it is. Then we'll be on our way.

RED SKULL (2014): Ah, liebchen– If only it were that easy.

[Red Skull leads Clint and Natasha to the cliff]

RED SKULL (2014): What you seek lies in front of you... as does what you fear.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: The stone is down there.

RED SKULL (2014): For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.

[scene cuts to Natasha sitting on a log while Clint watches the Stonekeeper.]

CLINT BARTON: How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: No. I don't think so.

CLINT BARTON: Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?

NATASHA ROMANOFF: I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.

CLINT BARTON: Yeah.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever it takes.

CLINT BARTON: Whatever it takes.

[Natasha stands up.]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead.

CLINT BARTON: Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: I guess we do.

[Clint holds Natasha's hand and she reciprocates and they look at each other]

CLINT BARTON: I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

CLINT BARTON: Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

CLINT BARTON: Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

CLINT BARTON: Maybe you should.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: You didn't.

CLINT BARTON: You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

[Both Clint and Natasha lean their heads against each other]

CLINT BARTON: Okay. You win.

[Clint smiles and knocks Natasha to the ground]

CLINT BARTON: Tell my family I love them.

[Natasha returns the favor by tackling Clint to the ground]

NATASHA ROMANOFF: You tell them yourself.

[Natasha electrocutes Clint and she runs towards the cliff. Clint gets up and shoots an explosive arrow knocking her down. Clint then runs towards the cliff and jumps. Natasha jumps after him and hooks him up to a grappling hook]

CLINT BARTON: Damn you!

NATASHA ROMANOFF: Let me go.

CLINT BARTON: No. Please, no.

NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's okay.

CLINT BARTON: Please– [Natasha kicks the wall, falls off the rope, and plummets to the ground.] NO!!!

[The shot shows her body on the ground, dead. A boom in the sky sends Clint in a pool of water with the Soul Stone in his hand. He hits the ground out of sadness. His Quantum Suit activates and he shrinks back to the present day, soon joined by the others returning from their journeys. Cut to the Avengers HQ and the Quantum platform everyone looks around to see all the recovered stones.]

BRUCE BANNER: Did we get them all?

RHODEY: You telling me this'll actually work?

[There's a pause as everyone starts to realise someone is missing.]

BRUCE BANNER: Clint, where's Nat?

[The silence from Clint tells them all they need to know. The mission was completed but at a dire cost. Sadness overtakes everyone. Bruce falls to his knees and pounds the floor in grief.]

[Cut to outside HQ. Lakeside, Tony, Steve, Thor, Clint, and Bruce are mourning their fallen teammate and friend.]

TONY STARK: Do we know if she had family?

STEVE ROGERS: Yeah. Us.

THOR: (confused) What?

TONY STARK: I just asked him a question–

THOR: Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.

CLINT BARTON: We can't get her back.

THOR: Wha– what?

CLINT BARTON: It can't be undone. It can't.

[Thor dryly laughs.]

THOR: I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think?

CLINT BARTON: (to Thor) Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?

THOR: No, that's my point–

CLINT BARTON: It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!

[Clint's anger is quickly replaced with grief]

CLINT BARTON: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.

[In a burst of anger, Bruce grabs a bench and hurls it clear across the lake. His anger spent, he turns to the others with a resigned look on his face]

BRUCE BANNER: She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.

STEVE ROGERS: We will.

[Cut to inside the Avenger's Lab. Tony carefully places the stones in the gauntlet he made while Bruce and Rocket watches. With nervous precision, Tony manipulates the machine and carefully places all six stones into the gauntlet]

ROCKET: Boom!

[Tony and Bruce jump a bit, and quickly groan at Rocket's joke. Scene cuts to another room with the new finished gauntlet. Everyone is gathered around it.]

ROCKET: All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?

THOR: I'll do it.

TONY Stark: Excuse me?

THOR: It's okay.

EVERYONE: (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Wait, wait–

STEVE ROGERS: Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. THOR: I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?

SCOTT LANG: We should at least discuss it.

THOR: No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.

TONY STARK: It's not about that–

THOR: (hushes everyone up) It's not that– Stop it! Just let me! (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.

TONY STARK : Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition.

THOR: What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

RHODEY: Cheez Whiz?

THOR: Lightning.

TONY STARK: Yeah.

BRUCE: Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me.

[Thor lets go of Tony. Sorry, Thor. Maybe next time.]

BRUCE BANNER: You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.

STEVE ROGERS: How do we know you will?

BRUCE BANNER: We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...I was made for this.

[Nebula (2014) sneaks off to the Quantum portal and activates it]

TONY STARK: Good to go, yeah?

BRUCE BANNER: Let's do it.

TONY STARK: You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.

BRUCE BANNER: Got it.

[Everyone gets ready and suits up]

TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss.

[Avengers facility goes on lockdown]

BRUCE BANNER: Everybody comes home.

[Bruce puts on the gauntlet, which nanobotically expands to fit his hand, and the power surge overwhelms him. He grunts in pain.]

THOR: Take it off! Take it off!

STEVE ROGERS: No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

TONY STARK: Talk to me, Banner.

BRUCE BANNER: I'm okay. I'm okay.

[Thor gives a double thumbs up, scene cuts to Nebula (2014) opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present. Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away.]

STEVE ROGERS: Bruce!

TONY STARK: Don't move him.

BRUCE ROGERS: [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work?

THOR: Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.

[Scott walks towards the outside windows and sees plants and birds. Clint hears his phone ringing and sees it's his wife calling]

CLINT BARTON: (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.

SCOTT LANG: Guys– I think it worked!

[Bruce opens his eyes and sees the Sanctuary II up in the sky and a single missile heading towards the base blowing away Scott away. Then a continuous array of missiles destroys the base completely and everyone sinks below to the underground.]

[The camera pans over to see Bruce holding up tons of debris from collapsing on top of the other Avengers with his one good arm. Some debris is stuck on top of Rocket.]

ROCKET: I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.

RHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]

BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!

[Rhodey crawls over to help Rocket while taking a rebar as leverage to lift the debris off Rocket]

ROCKET: Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!

[Rhodey gets Rocket out and they both sigh in relief]

BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey!

[A flood engulfs both Rhodey and Rocket]

[Scene cuts to Scott who survives the blast by shrinking.]

RHODEY: Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!

SCOTT LANG: What?

RHODEY: We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

SCOTT LANG: Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?

[Scene cuts to Clint in the sewer system and trying to get his bearings. He flashes a light upwards to see what happened.]

CLINT BARTON: Cap?

[Clint finds the gauntlet is with him but senses he's not alone down there. He shoots an arrow with light towards the dark tunnel and finds hordes of Outriders.]

CLINT BARTON: [under his breath] Damn.

[Clint takes the gauntlet and runs towards the opposite direction while the Outriders chase after him.]

[Scene cuts to the Sanctuary II and it beams Thanos (2014) fully armoured to the ground. Nebula walks towards him.]

THANOS (2014): Daughter.

NEBULA (2014): Yes, Father.

THANOS (2014): So, this is the future. Well done.

[Nebula (2014) takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away]

NEBULA (2014): Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.

[Thanos (2014) plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword's edge.]

THANOS (2014): The arrogant never do.

[Thanos then sits down]

THANOS (2014): Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.

NEBULA (2014): What will you do?

THANOS (2014): Wait.

[Nebula (2014) proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora (2014) watching. Gamora (2014) heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.]

GAMORA (2014): Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?

NEBULA: I tried to kill you. Several times.

[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]

NEBULA: But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters.

[Gamora (2014) holds out her hand.]

GAMORA (2014): Come on. We can stop him.

[Nebula takes it]

[Scene cuts to Tony walking towards Steve who's unconscious on the ground.]

TONY STARK: Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. [He has Cap's shield.] You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

STEVE ROGERS: What happened?

TONY STARK: You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.

[Tony helps Steve on his feet. They walk up to join Thor, who has been observing Thanos (2014) from a distance.]

TONY STARK: What's he been doing?

THOR: Absolutely nothing.

STEVE ROGERS: Where are the stones?

TONY STARK: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.

STEVE ROGERS: So we keep it that way.

THOR: You know it's a trap, right?

TONY STARK: Yeah. And I don't much care.

THOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time.

[The Big Three walk over to confront Thanos face to face]

THANOS (2014): You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.

TONY STARK: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.

THANOS (2014): I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do. [stands up] I will shred this universe down to its last atom. [Thanos (2014) puts on his helmet] And then– With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. [Thor lights himself up.] A grateful universe.

STEVE ROGERS: Born out of blood.

THANOS (2014): They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them.

[The fighting starts, and Thor and Tony go straight at Thanos (2014). Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.]

RHODEY: See you on the other side, man.

SCOTT LANG: Hang on! I'm coming!

[Hawkeye is running with the infinity gauntlet. He blows the place, and escapes before the Outriders overwhelm him. He sees Nebula.]

CLINT BARTON: Oh, hey– I know you.

[Clint gives her the gauntlet. then she puts her hand on her earpiece]

NEBULA: Father.

[Clint gasped and finds out that she's from 2014]

NEBULA (2014): I have the stones.

CLINT BARTON: What?!

[Clint tries to get up but Nebula (2014) steps her foot down on him an points her gun at him]

GAMORA (2014): Stop.

[Gamora (2014) come around the corner]

NEBULA (2014): You're betraying us?

[With her hands up, Nebula joins Gamora (2014). Nebula (2014) points her gun at her future self]

NEBULA: You don't have to do this.

NEBULA (2014): I am this.

GAMORA (2014): No, you're not.

NEBULA: You've seen what we become.

GAMORA (2014): Nebula, listen to her.

NEBULA: You can change.

NEBULA (2014): He won't let me.

[Nebula (2014) points a gun at Gamora (2014)]

GAMORA (2014): NO!

[Present Nebula shoots Nebula (2014) and she dies. Hawkeye picks up the Infinity Gauntlet]

[Cut to the 3 heroes battling Thanos]

TONY STARK: Okay, Thor. Hit me.

[Thor bangs his 2 hammers together combined with his lightning. Tony's suit sucks up the energy and he shoots it out using his hands and his body. Thanos twirls his blade really fast to divert the energy. Thor grabs Stormbreaker and uses it to bat Mjölnir to hit Thanos. Thanos uses Tony as a shield resulting in damage to his system.]

F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up!

[Steve tries to attack Thanos but is easily shielded away by the Mad Titan. Thor's attack on Thanos is blocked by his sword. Thor is beaten and choked by Thanos, as he punches him. Mjolnir is flicked away as Thanos relentlessly beats up Thor, throwing him into a tree and socking him before throwing him over rubble and socking him again. Thor tries to grab Stormbreaker but Thanos grabs it and uses it against Thor as he tries to defend himself. Mjölnir (2013) starts to float off the ground while Thanos is digging it into Thor, when suddenly Mjolnir flies into Thanos, zooms past, stops, and flies back, both look on in amazement as Steve picks up the hammer.]

THOR: I knew it!

[Thanos' (2014) kicks Thor to the ground and proceed to battle Steve dual wielding both his shield and Mjolnir (2013)]

[Steve proceeds to charge at Thanos swinging Mjolnir (2013) and hitting Thanos in the face knocking him down. Steve throws his shield and Thanos (2014) deflects, Steve throws Mjolnir (2013) to his shield creating a shockwave and knocking Thanos (2014) off his feet. Steve goes on the offensive on Thanos, throwing his shield first at Thanos and quickly hitting it back at him again with Mjolnir. He lines his arm back up and underarms a channel of lightning on Thanos who eventually gets the upper hand as he removes his helmet, stabs Steve on the leg and knocks Mjolnir (2013) out of his hand. Thanos proceed to destroy Steve's shield with his double-bladed sword and throws him across the battlefield.]

[Steve staggeredly tries to get up.]

THANOS (2014): In all my years of conquest– violence– slaughter– It was never personal. But I'll tell you now– what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet– I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.

[Thanos' (2014) entire army is summons to the ground which include the Children of Thanos, Chitauri, Sakaarans, Outriders and Chitauri Gorillas. Upon seeing the army descending on Earth, Steve slowly gets back to his feet. With a fierce determination, he tightens his broken shield to his arm and stands against Thanos' giant army alone. Suddenly, a crackling comes in on his communicator.]

SAM WILSON: Hey, Cap, you read me?

[Steve stops and looks around]

SAM WILSON: Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

[A yellow portal begins to form behind him.]

SAM WILSON: On your left.

[Steve looks behind to see the portal on his left side. Three figures step through; Okoye, Shuri, and Black Panther, fully restored and ready to fight. Steve and the revived Wakandans share a look when Sam zooms in from above in his Falcon armor. As he does, we see dozens more portals opening up all around the battlefield. Through one of these, we see Doctor Strange descend in. He is joined by Drax, Mantis, Star Lord, and Spider-Man. Everyone watches in confusion and awe as more and more heroes arrive from all corners of the universe, all backed up with forces of their own including Black Panther and his Wakandan army, Valkyrie and the Asgardians, Wong and the Masters of the Mystic Arts and several Ravager ships. Amongst the throngs of heroes we see Bucky, Groot, the Scarlet Witch, the Wasp, and Pepper Potts (clad in her own iron suit) arrive. Nearly every hero has magically been transported to the battlefield to face Thanos' hordes.]

DOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone?

WONG: What, you wanted more?

[Giant-Man emerges from the rubble of the Avengers facility with Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. The Avengers, Guardians, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers take up battle positions. The heroes standing across Thanos' forces.]

STEVE ROGERS: AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir] –assemble.

[Thor makes a battle cry, as does Black Panther and the heroes charge, the Avengers theme swelling with their stride. Thanos raises his sword towards them, commanding his army to charge as well. Then both sides collide. The camera switches between the meet-line, Drax and Korg, Pepper and Tony, all which are battling against Thanos' army.]

[Cuts to Steve and Thor fighting. Steve takes Stormbreaker but Thor flies to him and passes Mjolnir]

THOR: No, no, give me that. You have the little one. [best meme ever]

[Later, Tony is seen fighting some of Thanos' army. Cull Obsidian backhands him, sending him to the ground, but Spider-Man uses his webs to pull him to the ground, allowing Giant-Man to stomp him flat. Peter runs to Tony and helps him up.]

PETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us." And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time–

TONY STARK: He did? Oh, God.

PETER PARKER: What are you doing?

[Tony hugs Peter, who hugs him back.]

PETER PARKER: Oh, this is nice.

[Cut to Star-Lord Fighting a bunch of Sakaarans, killing all of them except one, which makes him fall over, but a off-screen shot kills him and he drops on Peter. Peter gets up and sees Gamora (2014). Thinking its present Gamora, he is shocked.]

PETER QUILL: Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora (2014)] I thought I lost you.

[Peter touches Gamora's hair, not knowing she isn't present Gamora. In response, Gamora (2014) grabs Peter's hand firmly off her hair.]

PETER QUILL: Ow.

GAMORA (2014): [Kicks Peter in the nuts, slightly hurting Peter] Don't– touch– [Kicks him again, this time harder] me!

[Peter falls from the pain, while Gamora (2014) wipes her face.]

PETER QUILL: You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.

GAMORA (2014): [to Nebula] This is the one? Seriously?

NEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree.

[Peter pointing to Gamora (2014) in confusion, then to Nebula in question, and then back to Gamora (2014).]

[Later, Clint is seen running with the gauntlet]

CLINT BARTON: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?

STEVE ROGERS: Get those stones as far away as possible!

BRUCE BANNER: No! We need to get them back where they came from.

TONY STARK: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.


SCOTT LANG: Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn't our only time machine.

[Scott presses the button, which activates Luis's van's Horn with the song La Cucaracha, which is heard from afar. Hearing so, Cap goes to higher ground.]

STEVE ROGERS: Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?

VALKYRIE: Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

TONY STARK: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

SCOTT LANG: Maybe ten minutes.

STEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

HOPE VAN DYNE: We're on it, Cap.

[Scott and Hope share a look and they shrink. Scott grabs Hope, and they fly to the van. Doctor Strange traps a group of Chitauri in his magic and sends them through portals as Tony joins him.]

TONY STARK: Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.

DOCTOR STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.

TONY STARK: You better be right.

[Cut to Scott and Hope entering a small hole in the van's window, getting to the drive seat, regrowing and trying to activate the Quantum Tunnel.]

THE WASP: It's a mess back here.

SCOTT LANG: It's– it's dead.

THE WASP: What?

SCOTT LANG: It's dead. I have to hotwire it.

THANOS (2014): Where's Nebula?

CORVUS GLAIVE: She's not responding.

EBONY MAW (2014): [pointing.] Sire!

[Thanos sees the gauntlet. Clint rushes through Outriders, before finding himself surrounded. He is saved by Black Panther.]

T'CHALLA: Clint! Give it to me.

[Clint gives the Gauntlet to T'Challa, and he runs towards the van while fighting Thanos' army. Eventually he is stopped by the double edged sword, boomeranged by Thanos. When it gets back to him, he charges T'Challa, but is stopped by Wanda, who is filled with anger for the loss of Vision.]

WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.

THANOS (2014): I don't even know who you are.

WANDA MAXIMOFF: You will.

[With her powers, Wanda picks up some debris on the ground and tries to crush Thanos with it.] [Ebony May grabs the Gauntlet with his telekinesis of bricks. He does the same for T'Challa, trying to stop him from getting the glove.]

PETER PARKER: I got it!

[Peter grabs the Gauntlet with his webshooters and is surrounded by Chitauri.]

PETER PARKER: Activate Instant Kill!

[The Robotic Spider Legs come out of his back, stabbing the Chitauri.]

[Thanos tries to kill Wanda with his double-bladed sword, but Wanda pushes it away. She then uses her powers to try and crush Thanos.]

THANOS (2014): Rain fire!

CORVUS GLAIVE: But sire, our troops!

THANOS (2014): Just do it!

[The spaceship cannons appear and start to fire at the heroes. It flings Maximoff away. Wong makes a shield and holds it up. The others do the same. Suddenly one of the cannons hit a dam. Water starts to flood into the battlefield. Pepper is the first to notice.]

PEPPER POTTS: Uh, is anyone else seeing this?

[Doctor Strange looks at the broken dam and uses his magic to stop the water from flooding the battlefield. Meanwhile, Peter is still battling the Chitauri.]

PETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!

STEVE: Hey, Queens, heads up.

[Steve throws Mjolnir, and Peter shoots a web and glides along, then Pepper Potts catches him]

PEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie's Pegasus]

PETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!

[The cannons knock Peter Parker off the Pegasus, then they turn to face something in the sky as all the cannons start shooting at something.]

SAM: What the hell is this?

TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

[A bright light of thundering energy comes surging down as Carol Danvers flies through the ship, and it results in an explosion and the ship crash-landing in the lake]

ROCKET: Oh, yeah!

STEVE ROGERS: Danvers, we need an assist here.

[Cut to Scott finally activating the Quantum Tunnel. Then cut to Carol Danvers landing near Peter, who is on the ground, weirdly hugging the gauntlet with his body.]

PETER PARKER: Hi. I'm– Peter Parker.

CAROL DANVERS: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?

PETER PARKER: [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.

[Wanda arrives, Valkyrie flying on her Pegasus as she arrives.]

WANDA MAXIMOFF: Don't worry.

OKOYE: She's got help.

[Pepper lands next to Okoye, followed by Mantis, Shuri, the Wasp, 2014 Gamora and Nebula. Thanos' army charges while the women help Carol Danvers go through the Outriders, Sakaarans and Chitauri. 2014 Gamora takes out a gorilla, while Okoye takes out Corvus Glaive. Wanda and Valkyrie destroy two leviathans. Carol Danvers then starts flying towards the van with the Gauntlet, flying past enemies and going through enemy blockades that are in her way with ease. Thanos, seeing this, starts running to Carol Danvers, but is stopped by Pepper, Shuri and The Wasp, who blast him backwards. Thanos, after seeing Carol Danvers fly past him, throws his double sword at the van, destroying it and the quantum realm tunnel, throwing Carol Danvers backwards and losing her grip on the Gauntlet, which falls to the ground. Doctor Strange steadies the water after the explosion. In the final brawl for the Stark Gauntlet, Stark moves one of Thanos' enemies aside and sees the Gauntlet. He runs to get it, but sees Thanos, who Stark tackles. Thanos smacks Stark away, knocking him out. Then Thor arrives with Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir in an attempt to pin Thanos' arm down, with assistance from Captain America. However, Thanos overpowers them and knocks them both out. After picking up the Gauntlet, Carol Danvers arrives, punching away at Thanos while he is holding the Gauntlet. She keeps punching him, but Thanos grabs her by the arm and flings her away. Thanos puts on the gauntlet, gamma radiation from the stones eating at him as he tries to snap, but Carol Danvers arises again, and stops his fingers from snapping, opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers: Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]

THANOS (2014): I am– inevitable.

[Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic "clink." He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, the gamma radiation coursing through him, to Thanos' shock.]

TONY STARK: And I– am– Iron Man.

[Tony snaps his fingers with a loud "CLANG" and a blinding flash of white. Rocket fires at a Leviathan and before it devours him, it crumbles into ash. The Black Order starts crumbling to ash. T'Challa and Quill look around in surprise; Steve looks on in exhaustion, knowing that they have won. Thanos, in horror, looks around and sees his entire army disintegrate. He looks at Steve, who just stares at him. Thanos sits down and mourns before slowly being erased from existence himself.]

[Cut back to Tony. The power of the gauntlet raw energy has left his entire right side fatally injured. He stumbles for a bit before his body collapses besides a pile of debris. Rhodey soon flies in and goes up to Tony to see his long time colleague and friend fading away. He bows his head, knowing the damage was done. Peter Parker soon flies in and sees Tony collapsed on the ground.]

PETER PARKER: Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it. [He kneels]

[Tony is unresponsive. Peter breaks down and hugs him.]

PETER PARKER: I'm sorry– Tony–

[Peter is gently led aside to grieve. Pepper Potts sits in front of the fading Iron Man.]

PEPPER POTTS: Hey.

[Tony is barely able to move his head, but manages to look Pepper in the eyes]

TONY STARK: [quietly] Hey, Pep..

[Pepper places her hand on Tony's Arc Reactor and Tony rests his hand on hers. Pepper takes a good look at Tony's fatal injuries.]

[pepper kneels]

PEPPER POTTS: F.R.I.D.A.Y.?

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical.

[Tony smiles with tears in his eyes.]

PEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.

[With that acknowledgement, Tony's arc reactor flickers off for good. Pepper can no longer contain her grief and starts crying on his shoulder. Tony Stark, Iron Man, Earth's Best Defender, died. All the heroes gather, and kneel in honor of Tony.]

[We cut to a montage showing reunions and celebrations. At Clint Barton's farm, he joyfully reunites with his family. At Peter Parker's school, Peter and Ned meet in the hallways. They share a handshake before giving each other a heartfelt hug. In San Francisco, Scott Lang watches fireworks with Cassie Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In Wakanda, T'Cahlla, Shuri, and Ramonda oversee the celebrations from their balcony. Over all this, we hear Tony's voice narrating.]

TONY STARK (voiceover): Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.

[Cut to the Stark household. Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, and Rhodey all watch Tony's holographic message being projected from his Iron Man helmet. Tony is sitting down recording the message.]

TONY STARK (hologram): So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's– it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. [Tony suddenly gets up walking towards his camera] What am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. [He leans down and smiles. He is looking straight at Morgan] I love you 3,000.

[The message ends and the hologram cuts out.]

[Cut to outside the cottage. Pepper carries a wreath out of the house to an audience waiting outside for the intimate funeral. She lays the wreath on the lake. On top of the wreath is Tony's first arc reactor which Pepper had framed with the words "Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart" back in 2008. The camera slowly pans to see Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, & Rhodey, all being joined by Steve Rogers, Peter Parker, May Parker, Thor, Bruce Banner, Doctor Strange, Wong, Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, Janet Van Dyne, Hank Pym, Peter Quill, Nebula, Rocket, Teenage Groot, Drax, Mantis, T'Challa, Okoye, Shuri, Clint Barton & his family, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Harley Keener, Secretary Ross, Maria Hill, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury, silently watching the wreath float away.]

[Cut to Clint and Wanda, standing by the riverside shortly afterwards.]

CLINT: You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda.] We did it.

WANDA MAXIMOFF: She knows– They both do.

[Clint gives her a side hug and Wanda reciprocates.]

[scene cuts to Happy and Morgan.]

HAPPY: How you doing, Squirt?

MORGAN STARK: Good.

HAPPY: You good? Okay. You hungry?

MORGAN STARK: Mm. Hm.

HAPPY: What do you want?

MORGAN STARK: Cheeseburgers.

HAPPY: You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

MORGAN STARK: Okay.

[Following the funeral for Tony, we cut to Thor and Valkyrie in New Asgard.]

VALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back?

THOR: Um– about that–

VALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king.

THOR: No, they already have one.

VALKYRIE: That's funny. You're being serious?

[Thor nods his head]

THOR: It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.

VALKYRIE: You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.

THOR: I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.

[Thor offers Valkyrie a farewell handshake]

VALKYRIE: What will you do?

THOR: I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though.

[Camera pans to the Benatar parked on the cliff]

ROCKET: Move it or lose it, hairbag.

[scene cuts to Quill searching for Gamora on the screen as Thor walks in he closes it]

THOR: Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well– [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first? [Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination]

QUILL: Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge.

THOR: I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course.

QUILL: See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

THOR: Quail– you– that– that's your own–

QUILL: Quail?

THOR: –insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.

QUILL: It's Quill.

THOR: That's what I said.

DRAX: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

NEBULA: Sounds fair.

[Quill looks around]

QUILL: It's not necessary.

THOR: It's not.

QUILL: Okay?

ROCKET: I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.

MANTIS: [enthusiastically] Oooh, yes. Please, use knives.

DRAX: Yeah, knives.

GROOT: I am Groot.

[Both Thor and Quill laugh but Quill tries to laugh harder]

QUILL: Not necessary...

THOR: There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.

QUILL: [glances at Thor] Me, right?

THOR: Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course.

[Scene cuts to Bruce, Steve, Sam and Bucky at the funeral]

BRUCE BANNER: Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

STEVE ROGERS: Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.

BRUCE BANNER: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss her, man.

STEVE ROGERS: Me, too.

Sam Wilson: You know, if you want, I can come with you.

STEVE ROGERS: You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though.

[Steve goes over to Bucky]

STEVE ROGERS: Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.

BUCKY BARNES: How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.

[They both hug each other]

BUCKY BARNES: Gonna miss you, Buddy.

STEVE ROGERS: It's gonna be okay, Buck.

[Steve goes over to the Quantum portal and dons the Quantum suit]

Sam Wilson: How long is this gonna take?

BRUCE BANNER: For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.

[Steve picks up Mjolnir (2013)]

BRUCE BANNER: Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay?

STEVE ROGERS: You bet.

BRUCE BANNER: Going quantum. Three, two, one–

[Steve disappears into the Quantum portal]

BRUCE BANNER: And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–

[Steve doesn't appear on the pad. Bruce looks around the equipment]

Sam Wilson: Where is he?

BRUCE BANNER: I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.

[Bucky turns around from the pad]

Sam Wilson: Well, get him back.

BRUCE BANNER: I'm trying.

Sam Wilson: Get him the hell back!

BRUCE BANNER: Hey, I said, I'm trying!

BUCKY BARNES: Sam...

[Sam walks toward Bucky. Sam, Bucky, and Bruce see old looking Steve sitting on a log. Sam and Bucky go near him.]

BUCKY BARNES: Go ahead.

[Bucky has a smile forming and looks over to Sam. He walks towards the old man and instantly recognizes the now-elderly Steve Rogers]

Sam Wilson: Cap?

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Hi, Sam.

[Old Steve looks over to Sam]

Sam Wilson: So did something go wrong, or did something go right?

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

Sam Wilson: How'd that work out for you?

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It was beautiful.

Sam Wilson: I'm happy for you. Truly.

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Thank you.

Sam Wilson: Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Oh, That reminds me. [brings out his shield.] Try it on.

[Sam look over to Bucky, who nods, and Sam holds Steve's shield.]

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: How does it feel?

Sam Wilson: Like it's someone else's.

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It isn't.

[Sam tries to hold back tears]

Sam Wilson: Thank you. I'll do my best.

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: That's why it's yours. [shakes Sam's hand]

Sam Wilson: [seeing elderly Steve's wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her?

(OLD) STEVE ROGERS: [smiling] No. No, I don't think I will. [Last lines]

[In the final scenes, Steve has time traveled back to the 1940s to be with Peggy Carter. They are seen dancing to "It's Been a Long, Long Time" in their home, and they end with a kiss.]

[In the very end of the film, the sound of hammering metal is heard in the background. A dedication to Tony Stark and a callback to the first Iron Man]

                                                     February 13, 2010


                         

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. NORTH SEA/VILLAGE - NIGHT

          We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
          lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
          straight out of the water.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few
          degrees South of freezing to death.
          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.
          The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
          village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single
          building is new.
          The camera drifts closer, circling.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          We have fishing, hunting, and a
          charming view of the sunsets. The
          only problems are the pests. You
          see, most places have mice or
          mosquitos. We have...
          Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
          snatched.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
          it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
          through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
          teenage Viking.

                         HICCUP
          ...dragons.

          EXT. STOICK'S HOUSE

          He reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front
          porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour
          out of the buildings, ready for a fight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 2.
          More dragons swarm in, setting rooftops alight and hauling
          off sheep.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Most people would leave. Not us.
          We're Vikings. We have stubbornness
          issues.
          Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into
          the streets, axes in hand.
          ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
          his way through the battle.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My name's Hiccup. Great name, I
          know. But it's not the worst.
          Parents believe a hideous name will
          frighten off gnomes and trolls.
          Like our charming Viking demeanor
          wouldn't do that.
          Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
          Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
          explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.

                         VIKING

                         (FIERCE)
          Arggghhhhh!
          (cheery, insane)
          Mornin'!
          Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
          men and women.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Meet the neighbors. Hoark the
          Haggard...

                         HOARK
          What are you doing out!?

                         HICCUP
          ... Burnthair the Broad...

                         BURNTHAIR
          Get inside!

                         HICCUP
          ... Phlegma the Fierce...

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          Get back inside!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 3.

                         HICCUP
          . Ack.
          He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep, just Ack.
          Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
          the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup!?
          (accusingly; to the crowd)
          What is he doing out again?!

                         (TO HICCUP)
          What are you doing out?! Get
          inside!
          The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard.
          He sets Hiccup down and turns to the sky, searching.

          HICCUP (V.O.)

                         (IN AWE)
          That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of
          the tribe. They say that when he
          was a baby he popped a dragon's
          head clean off of its shoulders.
          Do I believe it?
          Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
          strafing dragon out of the sky.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Yes I do.
          An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
          brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder.

                         STOICK
          (barking; to his men)
          What have we got?

                         VIKING #1
          Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh,
          and Hoark saw a Monstrous
          Nightmare.

                         STOICK
          Any Night Furies?

                         VIKING #1
          None so far.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 4.

                         STOICK

                         (RELIEVED)
          Good.

                         VIKING
          Hoist the torches!
          Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
          night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
          Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
          building with a tall chimney.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
          hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
          appendage.

                         GOBBER
          Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
          I thought you'd been carried off.
          Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
          scattered appendages.

                         HICCUP
          Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
          muscular for their taste. They
          wouldn't know what to do with all
          this.
          Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.

                         GOBBER
          They need toothpicks, don't they?
          Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
          the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          The meathead with attitude and
          interchangeable hands is Gobber.
          I've been his apprentice ever since
          I was little. Well...littler.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS


                         ON STOICK

                         STOICK
          We move to the lower defenses.
          We'll counter-attack with the
          catapults.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 5.
          Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
          safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
          strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          See? Old village. Lots and lots
          of new houses.

                         VIKING

          FIRE!
          In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
          four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
          they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
          them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
          Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
          The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
          And...

                         (DREAMY)
          Astrid.
          A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
          sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
          heroic.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Their job is so much cooler.
          Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
          Gobber and hoisted back inside.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEADING)
          Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
          need to make my mark.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
          All in the wrong places.

                         HICCUP
          Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
          dragon. My life will get infinitely
          better. I might even get a date.

                         GOBBER
          You can't lift a hammer. You can't
          swing an axe...
          Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... you can't even throw one of
          these.
          A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
          at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
          it into a heavy crash.

                         HICCUP
          (ready with the answer)
          Okay fine, but...
          He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
          bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... this will throw it for me.
          Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
          equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
          narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
          counter.

                         VIKING
          Arggh!

                         GOBBER
          See, now this right here is what
          I'm talking about.

                         HICCUP
          Mild calibration issue.

                         GOBBER
          Hiccup. If you ever want to get out
          there to fight dragons, you need
          to stop all...
          Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP

                         (ASTONISHED)
          But... you just pointed to all of
          me.

                         GOBBER
          Yes! That's it! Stop being all of
          you.

          Ohhhh...

                         GOBBER

                         (MIMICKING)
          Ohhhhh, yes.

                         HICCUP
          You, sir, are playing a dangerous
          game. Keeping this much,
          raw...Vikingness contained.

                         (BEAT)
          There will be consequences!
          Gobber tosses him a sword.

                         GOBBER
          I'll take my chances. Sword.
          Sharpen. Now.
          Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
          wheel. He stews... fantasizing...

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          One day I'll get out there. Because
          killing a dragon is everything
          around here.

          EXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS

          Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
          vacant house.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          A Nadder head is sure to get me at
          least noticed.
          The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
          walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
          Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
          fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Gronckles are tough. Taking down
          one of those would definitely get
          me a girlfriend.
          A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
          breathing gas into a chimney.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two
          heads, twice the status.
          A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
          The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
          together to reveal a single body.
          It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT

          TOWER.

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          They found the sheep!

                         STOICK

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Concentrate fire over the lower
          bank!

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          Fire!
          Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
          Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of
          the catapult with sticky fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          And then there's the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go
          after those. They have this nasty
          habit of setting themselves on
          fire.
          It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
          leering, toothy grin.

                         STOICK
          Reload! I'll take care of this.
          Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
          Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The
          catapult crew ducks.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          ON HICCUP, looking up from his work, reacting to the same
          sound.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          But the ultimate prize is the
          dragon no one has ever seen. We
          call it the--

                         VIKING
          Night Fury! Get down!
          Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CATAPULT - CONTINUOUS

          The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes
          flight. Stoick looks skyward.

                         STOICK

          JUMP!
          KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
          shell... sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This thing never steals food, never
          shows itself, and...
          The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...never misses.

                         (BEAT)
          No one has ever killed a Night
          Fury. That's why I'm going to be
          the first.

          IN THE STALL
          Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.

                         GOBBER
          Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me
          out there!
          Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Stay. Put. There. You know what I
          mean.
          Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING.
          ON HICCUP, a smirk crosses his face.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          WHAM! Hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of
          clustered Vikings. He weaves through the ongoing mayhem, as
          fast as his legs can carry him.

          Hiccup, where are you going!

                         VIKING #7
          Come back here!

                         HICCUP
          I know. Be right back!

          ON THE PLAIN BELOW
          The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close
          in, ready to spring upon them.
          Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
          surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
          A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
          clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
          shut.

                         STOICK
          Mind yourselves! The devils still
          have some juice in them.

          ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
          Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
          drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
          unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
          He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
          a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
          He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
          the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
          his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
          strike, completely camouflaged in the night.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Come on. Give me something to shoot
          at, give me something to shoot at.
          KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
          dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger.
          KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
          off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by
          a WHACK and a SCREECH.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (surprised, then elated)
          Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did
          anybody see that?
          Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
          appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Except for you.
          ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
          familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
          HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
          NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
          Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

                         STOICK
          (to his men, re: the

                         NADDERS)
          DO NOT let them escape!

          IN THE PLAZA
          Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
          Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
          buildings, setting them alight.
          Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
          shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
          around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
          of the Nightmare.
          He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
          It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
          Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
          to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
          earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
          coughs up smoke.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You're all out.
          He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
          away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
          turns to Hiccup.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh, and there's one more thing you
          need to know...

          The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
          basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
          goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
          netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
          sheep in tow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry, dad.

          EXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

          The escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches.
          The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won.
          The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.

                         HICCUP

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
          hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's not like the last few times,
          Dad. I mean I really actually hit
          it. You guys were busy and I had a
          very clear shot. It went down, just
          off Raven Point. Let's get a search
          party out there, before it--

                         STOICK
          --STOP! Just....stop.
          He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring
          expectantly.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Every time you step outside,
          disaster follows. Can you not see
          that I have bigger problems?
          Winter's almost here and I have an
          entire village to feed!
          Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.

                         HICCUP
          Between you and me, the village
          could do with a little less
          feeding, don't ya think?
          A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.

                         STOICK
          This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Why can't you follow the simplest
          orders?

                         HICCUP
          I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
          and I have to just... kill it, you
          know? It's who I am, Dad.

                         STOICK
          You are many things, Hiccup. But a
          dragon killer is not one of them.
          Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get back to the house.

                         (TO GOBBER)
          Make sure he gets there. I have his
          mess to clean up.
          Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
          Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
          teen fire brigade as they snicker.

                         TUFFNUT
          Quite the performance.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I've never seen anyone mess up that
          badly. That helped!

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, thank you. I was
          trying, so...
          Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
          house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I really did hit one.

                         GOBBER
          Sure, Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          He never listens.

                         GOBBER
          Well, it runs in the family.

                         HICCUP
          And when he does, it's always with
          this... disappointed scowl. Like
          someone skimped on the meat in his
          sandwich.

                         (MIMICKING STOICK)
          Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you
          brought me the wrong offspring. I
          ordered an extra large boy with
          beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on
          the side. This here. This is a
          talking fish bone.

                         GOBBER
          You're thinking about this all
          wrong. It's not so much what you
          look like. It's what's inside that
          he can't stand.
          Beat.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, for summing that up.
          They reach the doorway.

                         GOBBER
          Look, the point is, stop trying so
          hard to be something you're not.
          Hiccup SIGHS heavily.

                         HICCUP
          I just want to be one of you guys.
          Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes
          through the front door.
          And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
          woods, determined.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

          A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
          STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.

                         STOICK
          Either we finish them or they'll
          finish us! It's the only way we'll
          be rid of them! If we find the
          nest and destroy it, the dragons
          will leave. They'll find another
          home.

          He sinks his blade into a...
          LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
          pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
          painted sea monsters and dragons.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (DECIDEDLY)
          One more search. Before the ice
          sets in.

                         VIKING
          Those ships never come back.

                         STOICK

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard. Now who's with me?
          Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
          in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.

                         VIKING

                         (FEEBLE)

          VIKING (CONT'D)

                         (EQUALLY FEEBLE)
          I've gotta do my axe returns.

                         STOICK
          Alright. Those who stay will look
          after Hiccup.
          Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
          murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          To the ships!

                         SPITELOUT
          I'm with you Stoick!

                         STOICK

                         (DRY)
          That's more like it.
          The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
          alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
          attachment and scrapes back the bench.

                         GOBBER
          I'll pack my undies.

                         STOICK
          No, I need you to stay and train
          some new recruits.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
          Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
          steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
          time to himself...what could
          possibly go wrong?
          Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.

                         STOICK
          What am I going to do with him
          Gobber?

                         GOBBER
          Put him in training with the
          others.

                         STOICK
          No, I'm serious.

                         GOBBER
          So am I.
          Stoick turns to him, glaring.

                         STOICK
          He'd be killed before you let the
          first dragon out of its cage.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you don't know that.

                         STOICK
          I do know that, actually.

                         GOBBER
          No, you don't.

                         STOICK
          No, actually I do.

                         GOBBER
          No you don't!

                         STOICK
          Listen! You know what he's like.
          From the time he could crawl he's
          been...different. He doesn't
          listen.

          Has the attention span of a
          sparrow. I take him fishing and he
          goes hunting for... for trolls.

                         GOBBER

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Trolls exist! They steal your
          socks.

                         (DARKLY)
          But only the left ones. What's with
          that?

                         STOICK
          When I was a boy...

                         GOBBER

                         (GRUMBLING)
          Oh here we go.

                         STOICK
          My father told me to bang my head
          against a rock and I did it. I
          thought it was crazy, but I didn't
          question him. And you know what
          happened?

                         GOBBER
          You got a headache.

                         STOICK
          That rock split in two. It taught
          me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
          He could crush mountains, level
          forests, tame seas! Even as a boy,
          I knew what I was, what I had to
          become.

                         (BEAT)
          Hiccup is not that boy.

                         GOBBER
          You can't stop him, Stoick. You can
          only prepare him.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, I know it seems hopeless. But
          the truth is you won't always be
          around to protect him. He's going
          to get out there again. He's
          probably out there now.
          ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark.

          A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
          Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
          Sees nothing.
          He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
          over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
          and pockets it.

                         HICCUP
          Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people
          lose their knife or their mug. No,
          not me. I manage to lose an entire
          dragon.
          Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
          hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
          trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
          earth.
          He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
          tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,
          beaming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (IN SHOCK)
          Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This
          fixes everything.

                         (ELATED)
          Yes!
          He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen
          Night Fury.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have brought down this mighty
          beast!
          It suddenly shifts.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Whoa!
          Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
          Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
          dragon, dagger poised to strike.
          As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
          coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
          to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
          With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
          his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm
          gonna cut out your heart and take
          it to my father. I'm a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          I am a VIKING!
          Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking-
          ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched
          concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
          The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged.
          Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head,
          resigned to its fate.
          Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger
          aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a
          frustrated sigh.
          He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (muttered, ashamed)
          I did this.
          He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon,
          chest heaving.
          Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that
          no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes.
          The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching
          his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
          As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
          In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down,
          grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup
          is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup
          opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare
          boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.
          The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch
          him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns
          and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of
          trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,
          and drops out of view some distance away.
          Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,
          collapses to his knees, and faints.

          STOICK, seated on a thick slice of tree-trunk. He is slouched
          over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers
          waft around his beard.
          Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick
          seems none the wiser, when...

                         HICCUP
          I don't want to fight dragons.

                         STOICK
          Come on. Yes, you do.

                         HICCUP
          Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.

                         STOICK
          But you will kill dragons.

                         HICCUP
          No, I'm really very extra sure that
          I won't.

                         STOICK
          It's time Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          Can you not hear me?

                         STOICK
          This is serious son!
          Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags
          him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          When you carry this axe... you
          carry all of us with you. Which
          means you walk like us. You talk
          like us. You think like us. No more
          of...

                         (GESTURING NON-
          specifically at Hiccup)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP
          You just gestured to all of me.

                         STOICK
          Deal?

                         HICCUP
          This conversation is feeling very
          one-sided.

                         STOICK

          DEAL?!
          Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win
          argument.

                         HICCUP

                         (RESIGNED)
          Deal.
          Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and
          heads for the door.

                         STOICK
          Good. Train hard. I'll be back.
          Probably.

                         HICCUP
          And I'll be here. Maybe.
          Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          Gobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a vast
          stone arena.

                         GOBBER
          Welcome to dragon training!
          The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena
          floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the
          colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of
          blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place.

                         ASTRID
          No turning back.

                         TUFFNUT
          I hope I get some serious burns.

                         RUFFNUT
          I'm hoping for some mauling, like
          on my shoulder or lower back.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah, it's only fun if you get a
          scar out of it.

          HICCUP (O.S.)
          Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love
          it.
          The recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all
          around.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh great. Who let him in?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 23.

                         GOBBER
          Let's get started! The recruit who
          does best will win the honor of
          killing his first dragon in front
          of the entire village.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
          so does that disqualify him or...?
          The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.

                         TUFFNUT
          Can I transfer to the class with
          the cool Vikings?
          Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
          along.

                         GOBBER
          (cheery, in confidence)
          Don't worry. You're small and
          you're weak. That'll make you less
          of a target. They'll see you as
          sick or insane and go after the
          more Viking-like teens instead.
          GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on
          toward five massive reinforced doors. Terrible ROARS and
          BELLOWS issue from within.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Behind these doors are just a few
          of the many species you will learn
          to fight.
          Fishlegs bounces and giggles with excitement, barely able to
          contain himself.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The Deadly Nadder.

                         FISHLEGS
          (under his breath)
          Speed eight. Armor sixteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Hideous Zippleback.

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus eleven stealth. Times two.

                         GOBBER
          The Monstrous Nightmare.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 24.

                         FISHLEGS
          Firepower fifteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Terrible Terror.

                         FISHLEGS
          Attack eight. Venom twelve.

                         GOBBER

          CAN YOU STOP THAT?!

                         (BEAT)
          And...the Gronckle.

                         FISHLEGS
          (quietly; to himself)
          Jaw strength, eight.
          Gobber pulls a lever, raising the cross beam on the last of
          the doors.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa, wait! Aren't you gonna teach
          us first!?

                         GOBBER
          I believe in learning on the job.
          BAM! A GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the
          ring like an irate rhino.
          The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut
          and Tuffnut who rush toward it, like pumped-up rodeo clowns.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today is about survival. If you get
          blasted, you're dead. Quick, what's
          the first thing you're going to
          need?

                         HICCUP
          A doctor?

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus five speed?

                         ASTRID
          A shield.

                         GOBBER
          Shields. Go.
          The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered
          around the ring.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 25.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Your most important piece of
          equipment is your shield. If you
          must make a choice between a sword
          or a shield, take the shield.
          Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him
          running.
          Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has
          a skull painted on it. They both grab it.

                         TUFFNUT
          Get your hands off my shield!

                         RUFFNUT
          There are like a million shields!

                         TUFFNUT
          Take that one, it has a flower on
          it. Girls like flowers.
          Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He
          doesn't let go.

                         RUFFNUT
          Ooops, now this one has blood on
          it.
          The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The
          shield is blasted out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff
          SPIN like tops and go down.

                         GOBBER
          Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out!

                         TUFFNUT

                         (DAZED)
          What?!

                         RUFFNUT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What?!
          The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them
          back. The teens gather on the far side of the ring.

                         GOBBER
          Those shields are good for another
          thing. Noise. Make lots of it to
          throw off a dragon's aim.
          The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their
          shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 26.
          GRONCKLE'S POV - the teens targets become blurry and
          scrambled. It's working.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          All dragons have a limited number
          of shots. How many does a Gronckle
          have?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Five!

                         FISHLEGS
          No, six.

                         GOBBER
          Correct, six. That's one for each
          of you!

                         FISHLEGS
          I really don't think my parents

                         WOULD--
          BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs, out.
          Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slugs.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, get in there!
          ON ASTRID bouncing on her heels, ready to dodge a blast.
          Snotlout appears, trying to hit on her.

                         SNOTLOUT
          So anyway I'm moving into my
          parents' basement. You should come
          by sometime to work out. You look
          like you work out--
          She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
          her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back.

                         GOBBER
          Snotlout! You're done!
          Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly,
          trying to look cool.

                         HICCUP

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          So, I guess it's just you and me
          huh?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 27.

                         ASTRID
          No. Just you.
          Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
          Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.

                         GOBBER
          One shot left!
          Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across
          the ring.
          The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him,
          leaving Astrid in the clear.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)

                         (WORRIED)
          Hiccup!
          The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
          against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail,
          ready to fire point-blank.
          Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
          second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the
          stone wall above Hiccup's head.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (rattled, but masking it)
          And that's six!
          Gobber wrestles the irate Gronckle back into his pen.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Go back to bed, ya overgrown
          sausage! You'll get another chance,
          don't you worry.
          Slam! Lock. Gobber turns to the recruits.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Remember... a dragon will always,
          (with a stern look to

                         HICCUP)
          always go for the kill.
          He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks
          overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall.

          EXT. WOODS/HIDDEN COVE - DUSK

          HICCUP, battered after another disastrous day in the ring. He
          studies the remnants of the discarded bola... revealing that
          he's back at the scene of the crime.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 28.

                         HICCUP

                         (MUTTERED)
          So...why didn't you?
          He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
          off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an...
          ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans
          the high stone walls... then notices a single black SCALE on
          the ground. He crouches and picks it up, studying it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well this was stupid.
          SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils,
          watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It
          flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The
          dragon is trapped.
          Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer.
          He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps
          into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again,
          it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily.
          As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather-
          bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank
          page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the
          image.
          The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of
          the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings.
          The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the
          water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at
          them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking
          weakened.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          Why don't you just...fly away?
          ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing,
          carefully erasing one half of the dragon's tail. He
          accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the
          rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into
          the cove. TINK. TINK. TINK.
          The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
          exchange a profound, unflinching stare.

          INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          A storm is brewing outside. The great doors rattle on their
          hinges.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong
          in the ring today?
          The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the glow
          of the fire pit.

                         ASTRID
          I mistimed my summersault dive. It
          was sloppy. It threw off my
          reverse tumble.
          Eye rolls from the group.

                         RUFFNUT

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Yeah. We noticed.

                         SNOTLOUT
          (grabbing Astrid's hand)
          No, no, you were great. That was
          so 'Astrid'.

                         GOBBER
          She's right, you have to be tough
          on yourselves.
          CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
          sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (glaring at Hiccup)
          Where did Hiccup go wrong?
          He tries to take a seat at the table...

                         RUFFNUT
          He showed up.

                         TUFFNUT
          He didn't get eaten.
          ... but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes,
          Hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them.

                         ASTRID
          He's never where he should be.

                         GOBBER
          Thank you, Astrid.
          Gobber stands.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          You need to live and breathe this
          stuff.
          Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The dragon manual. Everything we
          know about every dragon we know of.
          A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours down outside.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          No attacks tonight. Study up.
          Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the
          book.

                         TUFFNUT
          (you've got to be kidding)
          Wait, you mean read?

                         RUFFNUT
          While we're still alive?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Why read words when you can just
          kill the stuff the words tell you
          stuff about?

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh! I've read it like, seven times.
          There's this water dragon that
          sprays boiling water at your face.
          And there's this other one that
          buries itself for like a week...
          The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.

                         TUFFNUT
          Yeah, that sounds great. There was
          a chance I was going to read
          that...

                         RUFFNUT
          ...but now...
          Snotlout gets up to go.

                         SNOTLOUT
          You guys read, I'll go kill stuff.
          The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh and there's this other one that
          has these spines that look like
          trees...
          Astrid is the last to go.

                         HICCUP
          So I guess we'll share--

                         ASTRID
          Read it.
          She pushes it toward him and leaves.

                         HICCUP
          All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll

                         SEE YOU--

          INT. GREAT HALL - LATE NIGHT


          ON HICCUP'S HAND
          OPENING the massive book. Thunder BOOMS outside. The hall is
          vacant and dark, but for the few candles he's pulled
          together.
          Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and
          frightening dragons.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Dragon classifications. Strike
          class. Fear class. Mystery class.
          Hiccup turns the page.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When startled, the Thunderdrum
          produces a concussive sound that
          can kill a man at close range.
          Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
          Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated
          Vikings. Another page, another dragon.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Timberjack. This gigantic creature
          has razor sharp wings that can
          slice through full grown
          trees...extremely dangerous. Kill
          on sight.
          The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own,
          shifting and squirming in the candlelight.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at
          its victim. Extremely dangerous.
          The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup
          is startled, but presses on.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Changewing. Even newly hatched
          dragons can spray acid. Kill on
          sight.
          He begins flipping through the pages. A blur of dragons...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
          Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.
          Burns its victims. Buries its
          victims. Chokes its victims. Turns
          its victims inside-out.
          Extremely dangerous. Extremely
          dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on
          sight. Kill on sight...
          Hiccup finally lands upon the page he's been looking for.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Night Fury.
          It's BLANK -- no image, save for a few, sparse details.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Speed unknown. Size unknown. The
          unholy offspring of lightning and

          Never engage this dragon. Your only
          chance, hide and pray it does not
          find you.
          Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to
          his drawing of Toothless. He lays it over the book's blank
          page and considers it.
          CLOSE ON the drawing of Toothless...

          EXT. HIGH SEAS - DAWN

          A painted DRAGON, with a sword run through it. It's the
          billowing sail of Stoick's ship.
          Stoick hovers over the familiar nautical map -- his eyes on
          the uncharted corner, swirling in mist and illustrations of
          dragons.

                         STOICK
          I can almost smell them. They're
          close. Steady.
          Stoick raises his gaze to...
          AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised,
          daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is visible. The three
          ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge, looking
          for an opening.
          ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what
          Stoick is considering.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Take us in.
          The helmsman steers Stoick's ship into the fog. The men draw

          The first ship disappears into the whiteout, followed by the
          other two.

          Suddenly a flash of light. A silhouette of a dragon. Hollers.
          Sounds of splitting and shattering wood. Plunges into the
          water. Another bright flash.

          MATCH CUT TO:

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - RING - DAY

          CLOSE ON a DRAGON painted onto a shield. Hiccup runs his
          finger over its outline.

                         HICCUP
          You know, I just happened to notice
          the book had nothing on Night
          Furies. Is there another book? Or a
          sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury
          pamphlet?
          KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt,
          leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and RUNS.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          FOCUS Hiccup! You're not even
          trying.
          CUT BACK to reveal a Deadly Nadder, loose in a maze-like
          arrangement of moveable walls. Gobber calls orders from
          above.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today... is all about attack.
          The Nadder hops from wall to wall, sending the recruits
          scurrying.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Nadders are quick and light on
          their feet. Your job is to be
          quicker and lighter.
          The teens move in, stumbling over Hiccup and his unwieldy
          shield. The Nadder spots Fishlegs' ample rear hiding behind a
          wall. It whips its tail of spikes. Fishlegs SCREAMS and lifts
          an entire wall to shield himself from the spray.

                         FISHLEGS
          I'm really beginning to question
          your teaching methods.

                         GOBBER
          Look for its blind spot. Every
          dragon has one. Find it, hide in
          it, and strike.

          Ruff and Tuff rush in, diving and rolling up to the Nadder's
          nose. The Nadder sniffs the air -- it can't see them. Tuff
          and Ruff are smashed together - too close for comfort.

                         RUFFNUT

                         (WHISPERED)
          Do you ever bathe?

                         TUFFNUT
          If you don't like it, then just get
          your own blind spot.

                         RUFFNUT
          How about I give you one!
          Ruff and Tuff SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise
          gives them away. The Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of
          them.

                         GOBBER
          Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so
          much.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.

                         HICCUP
          Hey, so how would one sneak up on a
          Night Fury?

                         GOBBER
          None one's ever met one and lived
          to tell the tale. Now get in there.

                         HICCUP
          I know, I know, but
          hypothetically...

                         (WHISPERED)
          Hiccup!
          She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide.
          A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising
          them by landing in front of her.
          Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She
          rears back to strike -- just as Snotlout LEAPS IN,
          protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Watch out babe. I'll take care of
          this.

                         ASTRID
          Hey!
          Snotlout MISSES. Astrid glares at him.

                         SNOTLOUT

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
          What do you want me to do, block
          out the sun? I could do that, but I
          don't have time right now!
          The Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in
          pursuit. She leaps and dives like a highly trained gymnast.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber again.

                         HICCUP
          They probably take the daytime off.
          You know, like a cat. Has anyone
          ever seen one napping?

                         GOBBER
          Hiccup!

                         ASTRID
          --Hiccup!
          Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like
          dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through the dust and
          crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled
          mess.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oooh! Love on the battlefield!

                         RUFFNUT
          She could do better.
          The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust.

                         HICCUP
          (struggling to untangle)
          Just... let me... why don't you...
          The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a
          Raptor.
          Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from
          Hiccup's shield... which is attached to his limp, gangly arm.
          She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free,
          still burrowed into the shield.

          She SPINS and SWINGS the axe and shield, scoring a DIRECT HIT
          on the oncoming Nadder's NOSE. It yelps and scurries off.

                         GOBBER
          Well done, Astrid.
          Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave.
          Hiccup gets to his feet -- all eyes are upon him. He turns to
          find Astrid glaring at him, winded.

                         ASTRID
          Is this some kind of a joke to you?
          Our parents' war is about to become
          ours. Figure out which side you're
          on.
          She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COVE - MAGIC HOUR


                         CLOSE ON
          A fish... being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and
          slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap in the
          rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing.
          Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove.
          A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him.
          Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a
          stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him... ready to
          pounce.
          Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so
          reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and
          hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses,
          carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The
          dragon calms.
          As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing
          teeth.

                         HICCUP
          Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn
          you had...
          A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the
          fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... teeth.
          The teeth retract again.
          Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup
          retreats nervously.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh, no. No, I don't have any more.
          The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the
          same position as before. The dragon closes in over him,
          staring blankly.
          A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk
          of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup
          realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
          Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up.
          The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a
          bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics
          him.
          Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless
          HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the
          cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature...
          and curls up on it like a giant dog.
          He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless
          tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to
          touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes
          the hint and leaves.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          It's MAGIC HOUR. Toothless wakes, hanging upside down from a
          tree. He spots Hiccup sitting on the other side of the cove.
          Sketching in the sand.
          CLOSE ON a sketch of Toothless. Hiccup draws with a stick,
          minding his own business. Toothless appears behind him,
          watching carefully. Aware of his presence, Hiccup continues,
          trying not to scare him off.
          Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an
          entire sapling, drawing lines in the sand. He rushes here and
          there, making haphazard lines in every direction.
          Finally, Toothless drops the tree and inspects his work. He
          seems pleased.

          Hiccup stands and takes in the sprawling scribble, amazed by
          it. He accidentally steps onto one of the lines, eliciting an
          instant growl from Toothless. He steps on it again. Toothless
          growls again. Realizing how sensitive he is, Hiccup steps
          carefully between each line, turning round and round until he
          unwittingly bumps into Toothless.
          Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup
          slowly extends his hand. Toothless hesitates. Hiccup turns
          his head away and closes his eyes. To his amazement,
          Toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against
          Hiccup's hand.
          In a flash, the dragon is gone, leaving Hiccup astounded.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Gobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned
          catapult tower, toasting campfire food around a roaring
          bonfire.

                         GOBBER
          ...and with one twist he took my
          hand and swallowed it whole. And I
          saw the look on his face.
          (can't deny it)
          I was delicious. He must have
          passed the word, because it wasn't
          a month before another one of them
          took my leg.

                         FISHLEGS
          Isn't it weird to think that your
          hand was inside a dragon. Like if
          your mind was still in control of
          it you could have killed the dragon
          from the inside by crushing his
          heart or something.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I swear I'm so angry right now.
          I'll avenge your beautiful hand and
          your beautiful foot. I'll chop off
          the legs of every dragon I fight,
          with my face.
          He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes.

                         GOBBER
          (with a mouthful)
          Un-unh. It's the wings and the
          tails you really want. If it can't
          fly, it can't get away. A downed
          dragon is a dead dragon.

          Gobber stands and stretches.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Alright. I'm off to bed. You should
          be too. Tomorrow we get into the
          big boys. Slowly but surely making
          our way up to the Monstrous
          Nightmare.
          (playful, taunting)
          But who'll win the honor of killing
          it?
          He hobbles off. The teens reflect.

                         TUFFNUT
          (very matter of fact)
          It's gonna be me.

                         (BEAT)
          It's my destiny. See?
          Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his
          arm.

          It's not a tattoo. It's a
          birthmark.

                         RUFFNUT
          Okay, I've been stuck with you
          since birth, and that was never
          there before.

                         TUFFNUT
          Yes it was. You've just never seen
          me from the left side until now.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a
          birthmark or a today-mark?
          Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches
          him as he leaves the bonfire.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's
          covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a
          candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to
          the drawing of Toothless.
          With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal
          stick and re-draws the missing tail.

                         CLOSE ON
          ... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with
          every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals.
          They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered,
          and dunked in a barrel.
          The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
          place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a
          mechanical fin.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DAWN

          Hiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full
          basket. He clicks the scale he found (like a jar top).
          Toothless approaches, sniffing him.

                         HICCUP
          Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast.
          I hope you're hungry.
          Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, that's disgusting.
          Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh..we've got some salmon...
          Toothless swallows it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... some nice Icelandic cod...
          Swallows those too.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... and a whole smoked eel.
          Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He
          shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive
          tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I
          don't like eel much either.
          Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
          distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it
          like a fan.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay. That's it. That's it, just
          stick with good stuff. And don't
          you mind me. I'll just be
          back...here. Minding my own
          business.
          Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time
          he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's okay.
          Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts
          up, slows its chewing to a halt.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay..
          The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps
          the prosthetic fin in place. He cinches the straps.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEASED)
          There. Not too bad. It works.
          Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his massive wings and takes to the
          air, carrying Hiccup with him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Woah! No! No! No!
          Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds
          away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and
          dive.
          Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition
          to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't
          correct his trajectory.

          Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded
          prosthetic. He reaches it and YANKS it open. The flared, fan-
          like appendage catches the air, stabilizing the twisting
          tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (excited, terrified)
          It's working!
          Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high
          into the air.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes! Yes, I did it.
          He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while
          trying to hold on. They're going to crash.
          Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the
          intense force of a turn.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          AAAAAGGGGHHHHH!
          He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive.
          Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same,
          plunging in a massive cannonball.
          Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears
          seconds later.

          Wait.
          They FREEZE. A tail SWEEPS out of the fog, taking them down.
          Their buckets spill.

          ON FISHLEGS AND HICCUP coming across them. They see the
          puddles of spilled water.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh, I'm hurt. I am very much hurt.

                         FISHLEGS
          Chances of survival are dwindling
          into single digits now...

                         HICCUP
          Look out!
          A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls
          his water at it, completely dousing the head. It leers and
          opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh. Wrong head.
          GAS FLOWS around their legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs!
          Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks flash
          in the smoke.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Now, Hiccup!
          The other head sweeps out of the smoke. Hiccup hurls his
          water with all his might. It arcs and drops short of the
          dragon's sparking mouth. The dragon grins, savoring the kill.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, come on!

                         GOBBER

          RUN, HICCUP!
          Gobber COVERS his eyes.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!
          Beat.
          The Zippleback hesitates. SNIFFS. Then retreats.
          The teens get to their feet, watching transfixed. Gobber
          peeks through his fingers to see...

          The Zippleback backing away from Hiccup. He stands and holds
          his hands out, as if controlling it.

                         HICCUP
          BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you
          make me tell you again!
          The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave,
          hissing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes, that's right. Back into your
          cage.
          Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL
          from earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it
          shut.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Now think about what you've done.
          Hiccup turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay! So are we done? Because I've
          got some things I need to...
          Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless group.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep...see you tomorrow.
          Astrid SNEERS. Something's going on.

          EXT. WOODS/COVE - SUNSET


          BEGIN MUSIC MONTAGE

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup cuts and stitches leather, draws and shapes steel. He
          works by candlelight. An overhead shot reveals what he's
          building: a harness, complete with handles and foot pedals.

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Hiccup appears before Toothless, holding the new prosthetic.
          Toothless runs off as Hiccup chases him down.

                         HICCUP
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 47.

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Toothless and Hiccup are zooming over the ocean. The tail
          breaks free sending Hiccup flying.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah! Whoa!

          INT. BLAKCSMITH STALL - LATER

          Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix
          himself to Toothless' saddle.

          EXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN

          Hiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary
          harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash-
          land in an open field.
          Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the
          tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of ‘dragon-
          nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in
          complete bliss.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING

          Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a
          fistful of ‘dragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's
          nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the
          knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground.
          The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful.
          From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is
          controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm.

          EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

          The recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and

          BOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a
          Gronkle to that before.

                         TUFFNUT
          How'd you do that?

                         RUFFNUT
          It was really cool.
          He squirms and invents an excuse.

                         HICCUP
          I left my axe back in the ring.
          He turns and hurries back.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You guys go on ahead and I'll catch
          up with you.
          Astrid watches, suspicious.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax
          and fall over.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER

          An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid
          moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing
          technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other
          kids look on from the sideline in amazement.

          INT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice
          him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving
          Astrid alone.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup!

                         SNOTLOUT
          What was that? Some kind of trick?
          What did you do?

                         TUFFNUT
          Hiccup, you're totally going to
          come in first, there's no question.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of
          light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light
          patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          A beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen.

                         GOBBER

          A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the
          recruits.

                         TUFFNUT
          Ha. It's like the size of my--
          Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
          Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm
          hurt, I am very much hurt!
          Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch
          trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
          retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again
          as Astrid looks on with suspicion.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Wow, he's better than you ever
          were.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices
          Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his
          trademark harnesses. She quickly tries to follow, but he
          loses her in the woods.
          She HUFFS, frustrated.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With
          Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him
          in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant
          kite tied to a tree stump. This harness seems to work.

          EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER

          The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face
          is red.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, great.

          EXT. BERK - NIGHT

          The streets are empty save for a lone Viking who crosses
          Hiccup's path.

                         VIKING
          Hiccup.
          Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
          he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall.
          Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and
          making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.

          ASTRID (O.S.)
          Hiccup?
          Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
          the saddle hook. It won't budge.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Are you in there?
          Too late - she's right outside.
          ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
          Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind
          him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window,
          still attached to Toothless' saddle.

                         HICCUP
          Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
          Hi Astrid.

                         ASTRID
          I normally don't care what people
          do, but you're acting weird. Well,
          weirder.
          Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As
          a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window
          shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED
          THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.
          Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.
          In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.

          EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

          A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with
          equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of
          onlookers, looking like a team of hometown heroes who just
          had their butts kicked.
          Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --
          last to disembark and glowering with battered pride.

                         SPITELOUT
          You don't want to know.
          Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the
          trashed ship.

                         GOBBER
          Well, I trust you found the nest at
          least?

                         STOICK
          Not even close.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Excellent.
          Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag
          with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.

                         STOICK
          I hope you had a little more
          success than me.

                         GOBBER
          Well, if by success, you mean that
          your parenting troubles are over
          with, then... yes.
          Stoick stops. What does that mean?
          A group of merry villagers rush past.

                         VIKING #1
          Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is
          so relieved.

          The village is throwing a party to

          Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns
          to Gobber.

          He's... gone?

                         GOBBER
          Yeah...most afternoons. But who can
          blame him? I mean the life of a
          celebrity is very rough. He can
          barely walk through the village
          without being swarmed by his new
          fans.
          Stoick is doubly confused.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup?

                         GOBBER

                         (BEAMING)
          Who would've thought, eh? He has
          this...way with the beasts.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON

          Toothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky.
          Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles
          below them.

                         HICCUP
          Okay there bud, we're gonna take
          this nice and slow.
          Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
          harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and
          their pedal position equivalents.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here we go. Here we go...position
          three, no four.
          He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll
          off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon
          sun.
          Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
          harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail
          appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every
          fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic.
          Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising
          from the sea.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Alright, it's go time. It's go
          time.
          They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on. Come on buddy. Come on
          buddy!
          They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Yes, it worked!
          The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
          sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          My fault.
          Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
          (referring to the cheat

                         SHEET)
          Position four, no three.
          They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
          the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every
          passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
          handles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is
          amazing! The wind in my...
          He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)

          ... CHEAT SHEET! STOP!!
          Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No!

          ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless,
          however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his
          wings.
          As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
          his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly
          finds himself detached, free-falling.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh gods! Oh no!
          Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
          spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (trying to calm Toothless)
          Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda
          angle yourself. No, no...come back
          down towards me. Come back down--
          Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much
          surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as
          the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
          After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the
          harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull
          Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
          They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a
          treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
          Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
          check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making
          it impossible.
          With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
          Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
          Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split-
          second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
          Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying
          obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved.
          He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          YEEAHHH!
          Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball.
          Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it.

          ON HICCUP'S FACE

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Ah, come on.

          EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - SUNSET

          Hiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach,
          snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a
          fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup
          smirks with forced politeness.

                         HICCUP
          Uh..no thanks.
          (gesturing to his fish on

                         A STICK)
          I'm good.
          Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and
          nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of
          fish.
          One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away.
          Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last
          fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and
          Toothless watch, amused. That is until...
          Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy
          Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the
          fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it
          back tauntingly.
          Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
          Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and
          Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing
          the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
          smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
          Hiccup laughs.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Not so fireproof on the inside, are
          you?
          Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here you go.
          The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and
          approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup
          is amazed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PENSIVE)
          Everything we know about you guys
          is wrong.

          Hiccup carefully pets him... sending the Terror into an
          immediate, blissful sleep.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - NIGHT

          HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
          Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
          Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
          quickly covers up his desk.

                         HICCUP
          Dad! You're back!
          He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
          prosthetic fin, and other drawings.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Gobber's not here, so...
          He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as
          much as possible.

                         STOICK
          I know. I came looking for you.

                         HICCUP

                         (CAUGHT)
          You did?

                         STOICK

                         (STERN)
          You've been keeping secrets.
          Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's
          contents with him.

                         HICCUP
          I...have?

                         STOICK
          Just how long did you think you
          could hide it from me?

                         HICCUP

                         (IN VAIN)
          I don't know what you're...

                         STOICK
          Nothing happens on this island
          without me hearing about it.

                         HICCUP
          Oh?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57.

                         STOICK
          So.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's talk about that dragon.
          Blood drains from Hiccup's face.

                         HICCUP
          Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was
          going to tell you. I just didn't
          know how to--
          Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You're not...upset?

                         STOICK
          What?! I was hoping for this!

                         HICCUP
          Uh...you were?

                         STOICK
          And believe me, it only gets
          better! Just wait til you spill a
          Nadder's guts for the first time.
          Hiccup's elated expression sinks.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And mount your first Gronckle head
          on a spear. What a feeling!
          Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him
          into the wall.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You really had me going there, son.
          All those years of the worst Viking
          Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was
          rough. I almost gave up on you!
          Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And all the while, you were holding
          out on me! Thor almighty!
          Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills
          the tiny room.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (RELIEVED)
          Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in
          the ring, we finally have something
          to talk about.
          Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick
          adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat.
          After a long, uncomfortable silence...

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh, I... brought you something.
          He presents a horned helmet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          To keep you safe in the ring.

                         HICCUP

                         (SINCERE)
          Wow. Thanks.
          Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.

                         STOICK
          Your mother would've wanted you to
          have it.

                         (HEARTFELT)
          It's half of her breast plate.
          Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Matching set. Keeps her close,
          y'know?
          Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
          You've held up your end of the
          deal.
          Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.

                         HICCUP
          I should really get to bed.

                         STOICK HICCUP
          (talking over each (talking over each

                         OTHER) OTHER)
          Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house.
          We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping
          glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh,
          like the hat. breast hat.

                         STOICK
          Well..uh..good night.
          Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more
          burdened than ever.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

          A Gronckle hovers above the ring, hunting victims as the teen
          recruits scramble.
          Astrid ducks behind a barrier to find Hiccup already there.
          She forces her axe at his throat.

                         ASTRID
          Stay out of my way! I'm winning
          this thing.

                         HICCUP
          Please, by all means.
          She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above
          cheers her on.

          VIKING IN CROWD
          You got it Astrid!
          Hiccup stands and looks around. Amidst the crowd of
          onlookers, Stoick watches keenly, beaming with pride.
          He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of encouragement.
          Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted
          smile.
          Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
          line toward him.

          BACK TO ASTRID
          ... as she catches her breath behind a barrier. She scowls,
          focused, determined.

                         ASTRID
          This time. This time for sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 60.
          With a FIERCE BATTLE-CRY she LEAPS from cover, axe cocked to
          throw.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaaaaa...
          And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has
          already laid the Gronckle out.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          ...aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No!
          Hiccup shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

          NO! NO! SON OF HALFTROLL RAT EATING

          MUNGE BUCKET!
          A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the
          village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff. Everyone
          lights up excitedly.

                         STOICK
          Wait! Wait!

                         HICCUP
          So, later.
          Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave.

                         GOBBER
          Not so fast.

                         HICCUP
          I'm kinda late for--

                         ASTRID

                         (LIVID)
          What? Late for what exactly?
          Stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd.

                         STOICK
          Okay quiet down. The elder has
          decided.
          Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points
          to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi
          shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.'
          Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative
          'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers.
          Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup.

                         GOBBER
          You've done it! You've done it,
          Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!

                         STOICK
          Ha, ha! That's my boy!
          Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried
          out to the cheering spectators...

                         HICCUP

                         (MASKING PANIC)
          Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't
          wait. I am so...

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DUSK


                         HICCUP
          ... leaving. We're leaving. Let's
          pack up. Looks like you and me are
          taking a little vacation, forever.
          Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket
          and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh..man...
          SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of...
          ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening
          her axe.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Aggh! What the--

                         (RECOMPOSING)
          What are you doing here?
          She hops off the rock and back him down, spinning her axe
          threateningly. Hiccup's eyes dart around nervously, searching
          for Toothless.

                         ASTRID
          I want to know what's going on. No
          one just gets as good as you do.
          Especially you. Start talking! Are
          you training with someone?

                         HICCUP
          Uh...training?
          She grabs him by his odd-looking harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 62.

                         ASTRID
          It better not involve... this.

                         HICCUP
          I know this looks really bad, but
          you see...this is, uh...
          They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove.
          Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to
          investigate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          You're right! You're right. I'm
          through with the lies. I've been
          making... outfits. So you got me.
          It's time everyone knew. Drag me
          back. Go ahead. Here we go.
          He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag
          him back.' Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards, driving him
          down.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do
          that?!

                         ASTRID
          That's for the lies.
          Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out
          body.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          And THAT'S for everything else.
          Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other
          side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see...
          A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling.

                         HICCUP

                         (FEEBLE)
          Oh man.
          She dives onto Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Get down! Run! Run!
          Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 63.
          Hiccup knocks Astrid's cocked axe to the ground, out of
          reach, then stops Toothless short of crushing her.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. It's okay! It's okay...
          Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with
          sand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (CALMING)
          She's a friend.
          Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is frozen. Toothless
          looks from her to Hiccup and back to her, confused.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          You just scared him.

                         ASTRID
          I scared him!?
          Hiccup makes a “be quiet” motion.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

                         (INTENSE WHISPER)
          Who is him?

          HICCUP.
          Astrid, Toothless. Toothless,
          Astrid.
          Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with
          pure disgust. She turns and RUNS for the village.

                         HICCUP
          We're dead.
          Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          Where do you think you're going?

          EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

          ASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her.
          She is suddenly SNATCHED into the air. Astrid SCREAMS.

                         ASTRID
          Oh great Odin's ghost, this is it!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 64.
          Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering
          pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles
          a hundred feet in the air.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup! Get me down from here!

                         HICCUP
          You have to give me a chance to
          explain.

                         ASTRID
          I'm not listening to ANYTHING you
          have to say!

                         HICCUP
          Then I won't speak. Just let me
          show you.
          Hiccup extends a hand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Please, Astrid.
          She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
          After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and
          reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She
          settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible.

                         ASTRID
          Now get me down.

                         HICCUP
          Toothless? Down. Gently.
          Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
          With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases
          the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          See? Nothing to be afraid of.
          Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
          The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the
          saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like
          a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs
          Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What is wrong with you?!
          Bad dragon!
          (mortified; to Astrid)
          He's not usually like this. Oh
          no...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 65.
          Toothless ROLLS and PLUMMETS toward the coastline far below.
          Astrid SCREAMS.
          Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping
          them in the froth.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless, what are you doing?!
          We need her to like us!
          Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          And now the spinning. Thank you for
          nothing you useless reptile.
          Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.

                         ASTRID
          Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just
          get me off of this thing.
          Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied,
          Toothless relents.
          They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her
          eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed
          of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
          ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky-
          scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite
          herself.
          Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          ...and levels off under a starry sky. They emerge from a
          blanket of clouds under the dancing Northern Lights,
          shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky.
          Below them, Berk's torches flicker in the inky darkness. The
          new perspective is breathtaking.
          Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin
          into his shoulder. The moment is not lost on either of them.
          Hiccup smiles nervously.
          Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
          open water, leaving the village lights behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 66.

                         ASTRID
          Alright I admit it. This is pretty
          cool. It's... amazing.

                         (BEAT)
          He's amazing.
          Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless' side.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          So what now?
          Hiccup groans. It's a problem without an answer.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, your final exam is
          tomorrow. You know you're going to
          have to kill...

                         (WHISPERED)
          ... kill a dragon.

                         HICCUP
          Don't remind me.
          A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates
          suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping
          into cloud cover.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What's happening? What
          is it?
          Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!'
          Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
          emerges.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Get down!
          Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
          appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in.

                         ASTRID
          What's going on?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Toothless. You've got to get us out
          of here, bud.
          Toothless HISSES.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 67.
          Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds,
          appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish
          and game in their talons.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERED)
          It looks like they're hauling in
          their kill.
          The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.

                         ASTRID
          What does that make us?
          The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through
          the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea
          stacks.
          They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera,
          glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into
          rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
          winding tunnel.
          It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with
          pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in
          hordes.
          The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
          a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.
          Hiccup is amazed.

                         HICCUP
          What my dad wouldn't give to find
          this.
          Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small
          shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile.
          Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of
          sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into
          the pit.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's satisfying to know that all of
          our food has been dumped down a
          hole.

                         ASTRID
          They're not eating any of it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 68.
          Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the
          pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic
          little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR
          rings out.
          The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan
          dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the
          air. Swallowing it back whole.
          Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          What is that?
          The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
          It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS.
          Several dragons take flight in fear.

                         HICCUP
          Alright buddy, we gotta get out of
          here. Now!
          Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping
          jaws.
          The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback
          out of the air instead.
          Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
          dragons flee the caldera in fear.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER

          Toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the
          moonlit beach.

                         ASTRID
          (her mind reeling, talking
          Hiccup's ear off)
          No, no, it totally makes sense.
          It's like a giant beehive. They're
          the workers... and that's their
          queen. It controls them.
          She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Let's find your dad.

                         HICCUP
          No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Astrid, we have to think this
          through carefully.
          Astrid eyes him, incredulous.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup, we just discovered the
          dragons' nest...the thing we've
          been after since Vikings first
          sailed here. And you want to keep
          it a secret? To protect your pet
          dragon? Are you serious?
          Hiccup stands firm, resolute.

                         HICCUP
          Yes.
          Astrid's taken aback.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          Then what do we do?

                         HICCUP
          Just give me until tomorrow. I'll
          figure something out.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.
          Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for kidnapping me.
          Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS,
          dismissive.
          Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES
          Hiccup on the cheek.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for, everything else.
          In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off...
          leaving Hiccup RUBBING his cheek, stunned.
          Toothless hobbles up, eyeing him.

                         HICCUP
          What are you looking at?

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          The grounds have been transformed. Banners and flags flap in
          the morning sun. Surrounding the ring, a festive crowd had
          gathered. All of Berk has turned out for the event.

                         STOICK
          (aloud to the crowd)
          Well, I can show my face in public
          again.

          LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PLAYFUL)
          If someone had told me that in a
          few short weeks, Hiccup would go
          from being, well... Hiccup, to
          placing first in dragon training...
          I would've tied him to a mast and
          shipped him off for fear he'd gone
          mad. Yes! And you know it!

                         (BEAT)
          But here we are. And no one's more
          surprised...
          ON HICCUP standing at the entrance to the ring, listening,
          looking burdened.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          ... or more proud than I am. Today,
          my boy becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE

          BECOMES ONE OF US!
          CHEERS and ROARS.
          Astrid approaches Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Be careful with that dragon.

                         HICCUP
          (re: the roaring crowd)
          It's not the dragon I'm worried
          about.

                         ASTRID

                         (WORRIED)
          What are you going to do?

                         HICCUP
          Put an end to this.
          She eyes him, dubious.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 71.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have to try.

                         (BEAT)
          Astrid. If something goes wrong...
          just make sure they don't find
          Toothless.

                         ASTRID

                         (GRIM)
          I will. Just promise me it won't go
          wrong.
          Hiccup can't. Gobber approaches.

                         GOBBER
          It's time, Hiccup. Knock him dead.
          Hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring.

          ON THE TEENS
          HOOTING and HOLLERING from the stands.

                         TUFFNUT
          Show 'em how it's done, my man!
          Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile.
          Hiccup returns a half-smile. Takes a deep breath.
          He hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon
          from a rack of many -- a small dagger.

                         STOICK

                         (MUTTERED)
          Hrmph. I would've gone for the
          hammer.
          Hiccup turns to face a bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep
          breath.

                         HICCUP
          I'm ready.
          The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet...
          Beat.
          BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire.
          Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears
          out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and
          jeers.
          It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing
          at the provoking crowd and blasting fire.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 72.
          It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming
          drool from its lips.
          The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight.
          With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup
          deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from
          them. The dragon pauses, confused.
          ON STOICK, also confused.

                         STOICK
          What is he doing?
          The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open
          hand. It snarls.

                         HICCUP

                         (WHISPERED)
          It's okay. It's okay.
          The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
          Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking a
          breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the
          helmet aside. It hits the ground.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm not one of them.
          GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
          ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset.
          Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the
          Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming
          down.

                         STOICK
          Stop the fight.

                         HICCUP
          No. I need you all to see this.
          The crowd gets restless.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          They're not what we think they are.
          We don't have to kill them.

                         STOICK

          I SAID STOP THE FIGHT!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 73.
          Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling
          the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter.
          Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
          Hiccup YELPS and springs backward.
          The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
          movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS
          and barely dives out of reach.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS


                         ON TOOTHLESS
          His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup scrambles around the ring. The Nightmare pursues,
          snapping and springing from ground to wall.
          Stoick pushes through the crowd, rushing to the doorway.

                         STOICK
          Out of my way!

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup!
          Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes
          through.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

          Toothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in
          desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an
          incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip
          of the stone wall.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          A narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he
          continues to dash around the ring, evading the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an
          attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys
          the rack and closes in on him.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

          Toothless tears through the woods, bounding like panther and
          taking to the air in short bursts.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 74.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps
          through. The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind
          Hiccup. Astrid is now in the ring.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup!
          She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous
          Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to
          Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate,
          waving her toward it.

                         STOICK
          This way!
          Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the
          doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares
          to finish him off.
          Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!
          Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the
          chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the
          boiling smoke.
          The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of
          wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and
          the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy,
          vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants
          himself between Hiccup and it.
          The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and
          ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away.
          To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and
          grabs Toothless protectively.

                         HICCUP

                         (PANICKED)
          Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of
          here!
          The crowd is gob-smacked, growing livid.

                         VIKINGS
          Night Fury!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 75.
          Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin
          pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into
          the ring.

                         HICCUP
          Go! GO!

                         VIKING
          Take it alive!
          Stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena. Astrid calls
          out to him, panicked.

                         ASTRID
          Stoick no!

                         HICCUP
          Dad! No! He won't hurt you!
          The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses
          them aside like rag dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, don't! You're only making it
          worse!
          Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless.
          Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! STOP!
          He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds.
          Everyone braces...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to Hiccup, not
          understanding.

                         VIKING
          Get him!
          The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down.
          Astrid holds Hiccup back.

                         HICCUP

                         (DESPERATE)
          No! Please...just don't hurt him.
          Please don't hurt him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 76.
          Stoick gets to his feet, fuming, shaken. A Viking presents
          Stoick with an axe. He eyes Toothless a moment, then pushes
          the axe back into the Viking's hands.

                         STOICK
          Put it with the others!
          His burning glare turn to Hiccup.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY


                         ON HICCUP
          Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
          SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past
          him. He paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and
          carved pillars -- a legacy of heroes, all peering down in
          angered judgement.

                         STOICK
          I should have known. I should have
          seen the signs.

                         HICCUP
          Dad.

                         STOICK
          We had a deal!
          Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS
          and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle.

                         HICCUP

                         (FLUSTERED)
          I know we did... but that was
          before... ughh, it's all so messed
          up.

                         STOICK
          So everything in the ring. A
          trick? A lie?
          He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting
          back words.

                         HICCUP
          I screwed up. I should have told
          you before now. Take this out on
          me, be mad at me, but please...
          just don't hurt Toothless.

                         STOICK
          The dragon? That's what you're
          worried about? Not the people you
          almost killed?!

                         HICCUP
          He was just protecting me! He's not
          dangerous.

                         STOICK
          They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!

                         HICCUP
          And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!
          They defend themselves, that's all!
          They raid us because they have to!
          If they don't bring enough food
          back, they'll be eaten themselves.

                         (BEAT)
          There's something else on their
          island dad...it's a dragon like--
          Stoick HUFFS.

                         STOICK
          --Their island?
          He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So you've been to the nest.

                         HICCUP
          Did I say nest?
          Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.

                         STOICK
          How did you find it?!

                         HICCUP
          No... I didn't. Toothless did.
          Only a dragon can find the island.
          Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on
          his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick
          stomps toward the doorway.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh no. No, Dad. No.
          Hiccup chases after him, panicked.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. It's not what you think. You
          don't know what you're up against.
          It's like nothing you've ever seen.
          He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He
          has no effect whatsoever.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. Please. I promise you that you
          can't win this one.
          Nothing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. Dad. No. For once in your life,

          WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LISTEN TO

          ME?!
          He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor.
          Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.

                         STOICK
          You've thrown your lot in with
          them. You're not a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not my son.
          Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone,
          devastated.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Ready the ships!

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick staggers on the steps, breaking inside.

          EXT. DOCKS/OPEN SEA - DAY

          Broken-down catapults and trebuchets are bundled up and
          lowered from the cliffs.
          Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the
          hulls of awaiting ships. Children and the elderly gather to
          on the walkways to wave apprehensive farewells to the
          departing warriors.
          Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained
          down to a palette, muzzled, and restrained with a weighty
          neck ring. He looks exhausted, miserable.

          Stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins
          the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor.
          Stoick's brow is furrowed, all warmth drained away. He turns
          west and glares at the horizon with cold determination.

                         STOICK
          Set sail! We head for Helheim's
          Gate.
          He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side
          perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and
          regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick
          breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead us home, Devil.

                         ON HICCUP
          Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't
          leave.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. CLIFFS - LATER


                         ON HICCUP
          Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon.
          CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him. She
          approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence.

                         ASTRID
          It's a mess.
          Hiccup doesn't respond.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          You must feel horrible. You've lost
          everything. Your father, your
          tribe, your best friend.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you for summing that up.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Why couldn't I have killed that
          dragon when I found him in the
          woods. It would have been better
          for everyone.

                         ASTRID
          Yep. The rest of us would have done
          it.

                         (BEAT)
          So why didn't you?
          Hiccup just shakes his head - he really doesn't know.
          Astrid's eyes glimmer. She wants something.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Why didn't you?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know. I couldn't.

                         ASTRID
          That's not an answer.

                         HICCUP

                         (BECOMING IRATE)
          Why is this so important to you all
          of a sudden?

                         ASTRID
          Because I want to remember what you
          say right now.

                         HICCUP
          (angry, loud)
          Oh for the love of -- I was a
          coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill
          a dragon.

                         ASTRID
          You said 'wouldn't' that time.

                         HICCUP

                         (BLOWS UP)
          Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundred
          years and I'm the first Viking who
          wouldn't kill a dragon!

          A BEAT.

                         ASTRID
          First to ride one, though.
          Hiccup blinks. He never looked at it that way before.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          So...

                         (REALIZING)
          ...I wouldn't kill him because he
          looked as frightened as I was.

                         (BEAT)
          I looked at him and I saw myself.
          Astrid turns to face the open sea.

                         ASTRID
          I bet he's really frightened now.

                         (PROVOKING)
          What are you going to do about it?
          Beat.

                         HICCUP
          Probably something stupid.

                         ASTRID
          Good. But you've already done that.
          Another beat.

                         HICCUP
          Then something crazy.
          Astrid smiles.

                         ASTRID
          That's more like it.

          EXT. OPEN SEA/DRAGON ISLAND - DAY

          The armada coasts toward a shroud of heavy fog, hung like
          drapes from a low-hanging, ominous sky.
          The ships enter, one by one. Visibility drops immediately.
          Flanking ships becomes ghosts. The armada disappears, drawn
          into the blinding mist. Complete whiteout. Nothing remains
          but the eerie creaking of wood on water.
          ON STOICK at the bow of his ship. He taps his fingers on the
          gunwale, then looks back at Toothless impatiently. Weighed
          down with chains, Toothless seems unresponsive.

                         STOICK
          Sound your positions. Stay within
          earshot.
          Shouts pour in from all directions.

                         VIKING #1
          Here.

                         VIKING #2
          One length to your stern.

                         VIKING #3
          On your starboard flank.

                         VIKING #4
          Three widths to port.

                         VIKING #5
          Ahead, at your bow.

                         VIKING #6
          Haven't a clue.
          ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue.
          Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to
          rip the ships to shreds.
          Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath.

                         GOBBER
          Listen... Stoick... I was
          overhearing some of the men just
          now and, well, some of them are
          wondering what it is we're up to
          here -- not me of course, I know
          you're always the man with the plan
          -- but some, not me, are wondering
          if there is in fact a plan at all,
          what it might be?

                         STOICK
          Find the nest and take it.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Of course. Send them running.
          The old Viking fall-back. Nice and
          simple.

                         STOICK
          Shhh.
          Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert,
          quietly reacting to inaudible sounds.
          Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller,
          moving the helmsman out of the way.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Step aside.
          Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following
          Toothless' head movements.

          The ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears
          out of the soupy fog.

                         VIKING
          Bear to port.
          The order is called out from ship to ship.
          CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack.
          Stoick continues to follow Toothless' cues, undeterred.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          Hiccup raises the bolt on the Monstrous Nightmare's pen.

          FISHLEGS (O.S.)
          If you're planning on getting
          eaten, I'd definitely go with the
          Gronckle.
          Hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits, watching him with
          folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a scowl.

                         TUFFNUT
          You were wise to seek help from the
          world's most deadly weapon.

                         (BEAT)
          It's me.

                         HICCUP
          Uh...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I love this plan.

                         HICCUP
          I didn't...

                         RUFFNUT
          You're crazy.

                         (SULTRY)
          I like that.

                         ASTRID
          So? What is the plan?
          Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends.

          EXT. FOGGY SEA - DAY

          The ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as
          orders are whispered from ship to ship.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 84.
          A dragon head looms out of the fog. The men recoil... only to
          discover that it's a wrecked ship, impaled high on a gnarled
          sea stack.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. I was wondering where that
          went.
          A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the
          sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the
          air.

                         STOICK
          Stay low and ready your weapons.
          Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows
          into shallow black sand.
          Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The
          BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers
          into the gloom.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          We're here.
          Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - RING - DAY

          Hiccup steps back from the door, drawing the Monstrous
          Nightmare out of its cave. It snorts, stepping into the ring,
          calmed by Hiccup's outstretched hand -- focused on him.
          ON THE TEENS... bewildered, in awe.
          Snotlout nervously reaches for a spear laying near his foot.
          Astrid stops him.

                         ASTRID

                         (CORRECTING)
          Uh-uh.
          Hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens, with the
          Nightmare inches from his outstretched hand.
          He reaches over and grabs Snotlout's trembling hand.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Wait! What are you...

                         HICCUP
          Relax. It's okay... it's okay.

          Hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with Snotlout's,
          putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare
          snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles
          nervously -- it's at once terrifying and amazing.
          The others watch, spellbound.
          Hiccup turns and walks away.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Where are you going?!
          Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box.

                         HICCUP
          You're going to need something to
          help you hold on.
          The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to
          reveal...
          ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens
          expectantly.

          EXT. DRAGON ISLAND - DAY


                         CLOSE ON
          Tree trunks, being sharpened and planted into the sand at
          angled rows.
          Boulders being loaded into catapult baskets.
          And a war plan being scratched in the sand.
          STOICK looms over it, looking determined. His generals are
          at his sides.

                         STOICK
          When we crack this mountain open,
          all hell is going to break loose.

                         GOBBER
          In my undies. Good thing I brought
          extras.
          Stoick TURNS to face the men.

                         STOICK
          No matter how this ends, it ends
          today.
          He walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several
          hundred warriors. He raises his arm and drops it.

          A line of catapults UNLEASH their two-ton loads into the
          cliff wall. It cracks and flakes away.
          Several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened
          lava.
          A final boulder shatters the fractured wall, creating a deep,
          dark opening to the cavern within.
          Silence. Stock raises his hand, makes a gesture. A flaming
          bushel is launched into the dark, lighting the wall... CHOKED

          WITH DRAGONS.
          Stoick pulls his hammer and rushes into the cave, brazen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          (War cries and slashing efforts)
          In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly rush out like bats
          from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the axe-swinging
          Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus.
          The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused.

                         GOBBER
          Is that it?
          Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleeing to
          the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades.

                         VIKINGS
          (Cheering as one)

                         SPITELOUT
          We've done it!
          Stoick doesn't celebrate. Something is not right. He HEARS
          something. Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the
          cavern.
          A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the cavern. The ground
          underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill with a
          blast of air.
          The cheering stops. Stoick's expression sinks.

                         STOICK
          This isn't over. Form your ranks!
          Hold together!
          The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get clear!

          The ground CRACKS. Stone tears away, cascading like an
          avalanche. And through the settling debris, the silhouette of
          a gargantuan dragon emerges -- THE RED DEATH. Stirred and
          furious.

                         GOBBER
          Beard of Thor...what is that?

                         STOICK

                         (AGHAST)
          Odin help us.

                         (BEAT)
          Catapults!
          The Vikings score direct hits. The burning stones BOUNCE off
          the dragon's skin. The Red Death focuses on the catapults.
          It crushes the first one - smashing it and its crew, rattling
          the beach underfoot.
          Stoick races toward the second catapult. He LEAPS and pushes
          a Viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him
          under his forepaw.
          The Vikings scramble in all directions.

                         VIKING #3
          Get to the ships!

                         STOICK
          No! NO!
          The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower.
          The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come
          down.
          Gobber Joins Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Heh. Smart, that one.
          Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.

                         STOICK

                         (GUILT-RIDDEN)
          I was a fool.
          The monster raises its head to the sky and BELLOWS. The
          sound SHAKES the beach, knocking Vikings off their feet.
          This island is his.
          Stoick stops a Viking General.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead the men to the far side of the
          island.

                         SPITELOUT
          Right.
          (turns to the others)
          Everybody to the far side of the
          island!
          The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with
          the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back
          to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the
          air, searching for their scent.
          Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench.
          Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.

                         STOICK
          Gobber, go with the men.

                         GOBBER
          I think I'll stay, just in case
          you're thinking of doing something
          crazy.
          Stoick grabs him.

                         STOICK

                         (EMPHATIC)
          I can buy them a few minutes if I
          give that thing someone to hunt.
          Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm,
          determined.

                         GOBBER
          Then I can double that time.
          Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and
          dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened
          post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face.

                         STOICK

          HERE!

                         GOBBER

          NO, HERE!
          It spots both of them. He fuels up to fire, glancing back and
          forth between the two men. He focuses on Stoick.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Come on! Fight me!

                         STOICK
          No, me!
          The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It
          rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when...
          KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's
          head. It turns distracted, as...
          ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the
          sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a
          Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding
          on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his
          waist.
          GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.

                         HICCUP
          Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move
          Fishlegs!
          The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake.
          Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out
          of reach and circle each other.

                         TUFFNUT
          Look at us, we're on a dragon!
          We're on dragons, all of us!

                         HICCUP
          Up, let's move it!
          The dragons climb past the Red Death.

          ON THE GROUND
          Gobber hobbles over to Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn
          Viking you ever were.
          Stoick is speechless.

          IN THE AIR
          The group circles over the dragon's head.

                         HICCUP
          Fishlegs, break it down.

                         FISHLEGS
          Okay. Heavily armored skull and
          tail made for bashing and crushing.

                         FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
          Steer clear of both. Small eyes,
          large nostrils. Relies on hearing
          and smell.

                         HICCUP
          Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind
          spot. Make some noise, keep it
          confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if
          it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

                         RUFFNUT
          That's my specialty.

                         TUFFNUT
          Since when? Everyone knows I'm
          more irritating. See.

                         (IRRITATING SOUNDS)

                         HICCUP

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Just do what I told you. I'll be
          back as soon as I can.

                         TUFFNUT
          Don't worry, we got it covered!

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah!
          Hiccup and Astrid peel away. The teens bank and dive toward
          the monster, splitting up. The Twins race alongside the
          monster's head, taunting it.

                         TUFFNUT
          Troll!

                         RUFFNUT

                         TUFFNUT
          Bride of Grendel!
          The Red Death unloads a spray of fire at the twins. They
          barely dodge it.
          Fishlegs and Snotlout hang behind its eyes, banging away at
          their shields, making a racket.
          The Red Death opens all SIX of its eyes, spotting them.

                         FISHLEGS
          Uh, this thing doesn't have a blind
          spot.

          ON HICCUP AND ASTRID
          ... searching for Toothless. Hiccup spots him among the
          burning ships.

                         HICCUP
          There!
          He steers the Nadder over the deck and hands Astrid the
          reins. He lines up his jump... and hops off, guarding his
          face from the flames. He lands on the burning deck.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Go help the others!
          She and the Nadder take off.
          As Hiccup fights his way to Toothless. He unbuckles the
          muzzle. Toothless shrieks.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, hold on. Hold on.
          He gets to work on the chains.

          ON SNOTLOUT AND FISHLEGS
          They clang their weapons against their shields, making the
          monster wince.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It's working.
          The huge beast starts to sway its head dizzily.

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah! It's working.
          PAN DOWN to reveal that the noise is also confusing the
          Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare. Both dragons lose their
          bearings.
          The Red Death thrashes, knocking Snotlout off of his dragon
          and onto the monster's gigantic head. Snotlout bounces across
          the top and comes to a stop just shy of the hundred foot
          drop.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Agghh!
          Fishlegs' Gronckle goes down in a spin of confusion.

                         FISHLEGS
          I've lost power on the Gronckle.
          Snotlout! Do something!
          He hurls Snotlout his hammer. The Gronkle crashes and skids
          to a stop...

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
          I'm okay!
          ... then flips over, crushing Fishlegs.

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

                         (FEEBLE)
          Less okay.

          BACK TO SNOTLOUT
          ... who eyes the Red Death's gigantic, veiny eyes. He raises
          the hammer...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I can't miss!
          ... and hammers the monster's eyes, playing whack-a-mole.

          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
          What's wrong buddy, got something
          in your eye?
          Astrid flies by on her Nadder, catching Snotlout in all his
          heroics.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah! You're the Viking!
          Snotlout grins, finally vindicated in her eyes. In his
          distraction, he gets thrown and lands heavily on one of the
          Red Death's spines -- clinging precariously. A close call.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa!

          ON THE GROUND
          The monster's tail sweeps across the burning ships, snapping
          masts like twigs. We follow one down as it crashes onto a
          deck, revealing...

                         HICCUP
          Working at the chains. He can't budge them. Fire licks at his
          clothes. He looks up to see...

          THE RED DEATH blasting at the teens, enraged.
          The monster's giant foot crashes through frame, smashing the
          bow under its impressive weight.
          Hiccup and Toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom
          of burning planks and rigging.

                         UNDERWATER
          Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess
          of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette settles
          into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped
          struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains -
          he's almost out of air.
          Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup.
          STOICK explodes to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the
          shoreline through flaming debris. He lays him down, under the
          shelter of an overhanging rock.

                         HICCUP

                         (OVERWHELMED)
          Dad...
          Stoick dives back into the water between flaming flotsam.

                         UNDERWATER
          ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears in front of him.
          Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the yoke
          and lets it float free.
          Momentary stillness. They eye each other, through the churned
          up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars -- grabbing
          Stoick.
          BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on the
          shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed.
          The ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its
          massive claws stomp around in the smoke.
          Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and raises his
          wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - ‘Let's go.'

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You got it, bud.
          Hiccup climbs onto Toothless and buckles himself in.
          Stoick grabs his arm.

          Hiccup. I'm sorry...for
          everything.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah...me too.

                         STOICK
          You don't have to go up there.

                         HICCUP
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard.
          They exchange smiles.

                         STOICK
          I'm proud to call you my son.
          Hiccup beams, taken aback.

                         HICCUP
          Thanks dad.
          Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm.
          Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief
          in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.

          IN THE AIR
          Astrid sees Toothless streaking through the sky, gaining
          altitude.

                         ASTRID
          He's up!
          She turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are ARGUING and
          THROWING PUNCHES at each other.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Get Snotlout out of there!
          IN MID-PUNCH, the twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on
          the monster's head. They eye each other.

                         TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          I'm on it! I'm on it!

                         TUFFNUT
          I'm on it first! I'm ahead of you.
          The twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their
          Zippleback in his direction.

                         RUFFNUT
          Hey! Let me drive!
          The twins peel off, ARGUING as they race each other to the
          monster.
          Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES
          down the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn...
          As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly
          snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each
          other, surprised and impressed.

                         TUFFNUT
          I can't believe that worked.
          The Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast.
          She and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward
          the monster's gaping mouth.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of
          the...

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!

          IN THE AIR
          A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid
          is thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles
          through the air. The ground races toward her, when...
          She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Did you get her?
          Toothless grunts.

          ON THE GROUND
          They fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid-
          run. They circle back to reengage - a black speck against the
          clouds.

                         ASTRID

                         (BREATHLESS)
          Go.

          IN THE AIR

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 96.
          Hiccup and Toothless rocket past the Red Death's head and
          climb, higher and higher.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          That thing has wings! Okay, let's
          see if it can use them!
          Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining
          tremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the
          Red Death as super sonic speed.
          KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's
          head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen
          monster... as its wings unfold and extend.

          IN THE AIR
          Hiccup looks back as they put distance between them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Do you think that did it?
          Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping
          its wings furiously. A daunting sight.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well, he can fly.
          Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they
          weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red
          Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and
          Toothless PULL AHEAD.
          The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in
          behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations
          like they were saplings.

          ON THE GROUND
          Stoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch as Hiccup and Toothless
          streak past, weaving through sea stacks.

                         TEENS
          Woohoo! Yeah!
          A moment later the Red Death SMASHES the sea stacks to dust
          in hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is quenched.

          IN THE AIR

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 97.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes
          the clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Okay Toothless, time to disappear.
          Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the
          clouds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on bud!
          The Red Death follows, closing in fast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (hearing the gas)
          Here it comes!
          BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They
          reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster
          follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.
          It roars irritably.
          From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,
          BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and
          Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at
          them.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding
          BOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the clouds.
          Gobber places a hand on Stoick's shoulder.

          IN THE AIR
          HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the
          clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monster's
          wings.
          It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire
          blindly, in all directions.
          Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Watch out!
          The random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 98.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, time's up. Let's see if this
          works.
          He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the
          Red Death's face, taunting it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on! Is that the best you can
          do!?
          Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a
          steep dive. The Red Death pursues.
          Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone
          before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death
          -- no longer trying to evade it.
          Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Stay with me buddy. We're good.
          Just a little bit longer.
          The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds
          Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on
          them. It narrows its eyes.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Hold, Toothless.
          The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates
          from his throat -- ignition is coming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NOW!
          Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.
          They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's
          mouth.
          Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its
          amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,
          erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.
          Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot
          on their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and
          sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,
          attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged
          wings can't stop its momentum.
          As the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees
          Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past
          its head.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 99.
          The Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like
          the Hindenburg.
          Hiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back
          plates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of
          the FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward
          them, about to swallow them.
          They manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.
          They're outrunning the fireball.
          He looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive
          club tail careening toward them.
          He tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of
          Toothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. No.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the
          air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from
          the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
          the fast-approaching fireball.
          Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the
          unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear
          into the boiling inferno.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          A whiteout of ash. And through it comes...

                         STOICK
          Hiccup? Hiccup!?
          Stoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is
          scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!? Son!?
          Through the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of
          Toothless.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (GRAVE)
          Hiccup.

          He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but
          conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.
          Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,
          overwhelmed by the loss.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh son...I did this...
          Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.
          Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped
          over.
          Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful
          distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild
          dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between
          the Vikings.
          Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.
          Their eyes meet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          I'm so sorry...
          Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,
          clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup.
          He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts
          into relieved laughter.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          He's alive!

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You brought him back alive!
          The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look
          around to find themselves surrounded.
          Stoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PRIVATELY)
          Thank you... for saving my son.
          Gobber looks Hiccup up and down.

                         GOBBER
          Well, you know... most of him.
          Stoick glances back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his
          eyes toward...

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - DAY


                         CLOSE ON
          HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his
          face show that maybe a week or two have passed.
          Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently.
          Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes.

                         HICCUP

                         (GROGGY)
          Oh, hey Toothless.
          Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you
          too, bud. Now just--
          Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
          UPRIGHT with a YELP.
          He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
          the fire pit on the main floor of his house.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm in my house.
          (re: Toothless, leaning
          over him, excited)
          You're in my house.
          Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
          too big for the space.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh...does my dad know you're in
          here?!
          Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He
          eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with
          'happy dog' energy.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (DISTRESSED)
          Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,
          come on...
          Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing
          that something is wrong.
          He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,
          horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 102.

          ON THE BARE FLOOR
          His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
          prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
          spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
          Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
          the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
          aware of what Hiccup is going through.
          Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
          it. He winces and stifles the pain...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay...
          ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches
          Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,
          stabilizing him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Thanks bud.
          Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
          together.
          Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
          their way toward the door.
          Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
          revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
          Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
          Toothless, alarmed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless? Stay here, bud.
          Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
          outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
          revealing...
          ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Come on guys, get ready! Hold on
          tight! Here we go!
          A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a
          variety of dragons, pulling back the curtain on an amazing
          vista in which:

          Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
          rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
          isn't a sword in sight.
          Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
          onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
          into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
          his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
          his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
          check it for size.
          Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
          on the step.

                         HICCUP
          I knew it. I'm dead.
          Stoick laughs.

                         STOICK
          No, but you gave it your best shot.
          He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to
          the transformed village.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So? What do you think?
          Hiccup just shrugs, amazed.
          Below, the plaza, villagers take notice.

                         VIKING #1
          Hey look! It's Hiccup!
          They rush over, surrounding him with a hero's welcome.

                         VIKING #2
          Hiccup, how you doin' mate?

                         VIKING #3
          It's great to see you up and about.

                         STOICK

                         (SWEETLY)
          Turns out all we needed was a
          little more of...

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Well. Most of you.
          Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (re: the prosthetic leg)
          That bit's my handiwork. With a
          little Hiccup flare thrown in.
          Think it'll do?

                         HICCUP
          (bittersweet, coming to

                         TERMS)
          I might make a few tweaks.
          Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
          with a grumble.

                         ASTRID
          That's for scaring me.

                         HICCUP

                         (PROTESTING)
          What, is it always going to be this
          way? Cause I...
          She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
          hollers follow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... could get used to it.
          Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
          tail.

                         GOBBER
          Welcome home.
          Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
          unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.

                         VIKING
          Night Fury, get down!
          Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
          the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
          sheepish grin.

                         CLOSE ON

                         CLOSE ON
          Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 105.
          The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
          Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
          The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns
          emblazoned on it. Hiccup approves.

          CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
          Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
          backs her Nadder into position.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You ready?
          Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
          From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This... is Berk.

                         (BEAT)
          It snows nine months of the year...
          and hails the other three.
          They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid
          follows, giving chase.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Any food that grows here is tough
          and tasteless. The people that grow
          here are even more so.
          Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village --
          under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between
          ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The only upsides are the pets.
          While other places have...ponies or
          parrots, we have...
          Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
          rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
          blazing, multicolored dragons.
          Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
          blinding sun.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                         (PROUDLY)
          ... dragons.

           EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY


                         
           Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads...                         

                         

           EXT. BERK - DAY

           (Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. The best kept
           secret this side of, well,
           anywhere. Granted, it may not look
           like much, but this wet heap of
           rock packs more than a few
           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Life here is amazing, just not for
           the faint of heart. See, where most
           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           DRAGON RACING!

          It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
          faces and perched over the sea.

                         
          FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
          who carries the sheep in her claws, until...

                         
          SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
          Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you
           want that?

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Snotlout! That's mine!
          Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
          their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Here ya go, babe.
          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Did I tell you that you look
           amazing today? `Cause you do.

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf. It's starting to
           stink around here.
          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
          with a mugging grin.

                          TUFFNUT
           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
           this place, Belch!
          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

                          STOICK
           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
           lags with three, Fishlegs and
           Snotlout trail with NONE!
          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
          painted with an image of Toothless.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
           found. Hmmm.

                          GOBBER
           Scared him off with the big talk,
           didn't ya, Stoick?
          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
          herself.

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing, Snotlout?!
           They're going to win now!

                          SNOTLOUT
           She's my princess! Whatever she
           wants, she gets.

                          ASTRID
           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
           you alive?!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Only for a few hours!
          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Dragons used to be a bit of a
           problem here. But that was five
           years ago. Now they've all moved
           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
          friendly additions.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We have custom stables... all-you-
           can-eat feeding stations... a full
           service dragon wash...

                         
          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
          one of the Viking houses aflame.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Even top-of-the-line fire
           prevention, if I do say so myself.
          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                         

                          STOICK
           It's time, Gobber.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Righty-ho!
           (aloud, to the crowd)
           Last lap!
          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

                          ASTRID
           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
           We can still win this thing!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Let's go!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Go, Meatlug!
          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is your big moment. Have a
           nice flight!

                         
          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
          it.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, up, up!
          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
          sheep.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           No!

                          FISHLEGS
           Good job, Meatlug!
          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
           ten!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

                         

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yeah! The Black Sheep!
          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

                          ASTRID
           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

                          RUFFNUT
           I'm totally winning!

                         
          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           We're winning together!
          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

                          RUFFNUT
           No one can stop me now!

                          TUFFNUT
           Except for me. We're attached,
           genius!

                         
          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
          war.

                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Quit trying to steal all my glory!
          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
          them, CLOSING IN.

                         

                          STOICK
           Get `em, Astrid!

                         

                          TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
          glory! EVERYTHING!
          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

                          ASTRID
           Gotcha!

                         
          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
          landing, black sheep in hand.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Astrid!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

                         

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                         

                          STOICK
           Well played! Hahaha!
           (gloating, to the crowd)
           That's my future daughter-in-law!

          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Uh, excuse me.

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!
          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
          sheep into their basket!

                         

                          STOICK
           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
           game!
          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
          basking in her victory.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
           All of my hard work has paid off.
           And it's a good thing, too, because
           with Vikings on the backs of
           dragons, the world just got a whole
           lot bigger.

                         

          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
          freedom.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

                         

                         
          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
          refinement, making them seem effortless.

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!
          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
          as they soar in formation.
          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What do you think, bud? Wanna give
           this another shot?

                         
          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! It'll be fine.
          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ready?
          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

                         
          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
          But he's flying!
          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
          Independently together.
          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
          crossing paths again.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

                         

                         
          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is amazing!
          A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
          FORMATION, dead ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No longer amazing! Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, no!
          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
          stows his leather wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That really came out of nowhere.
          The blown up sea stack collapses.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta work on your solo gliding
           there, bud. That locked-up tail
           makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
           maneuvers, eh?
          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
          with a Viking braid.
          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
          dappled afternoon sunlight.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Looks like we found another one,
           bud.
          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
          pebbles like a wet dog.
          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
           Is that why you're pouting, big
           baby boo? Well... try this on!
          Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
           on all my heartfelt remorse?
          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

                          ONE-LEGGED--

                         
          Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You're right! You're right! You
           win! You win!
          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
           and Vikings, enemies again, locked
           in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Gaaaaagh!

                         
          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
          shaking off the viscous saliva.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

                         
          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

                         
          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
          produces a leather-bound book.

                         
          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
          dragons.
          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
          forearm.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           So what should we name it?
          Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           "Itchy Armpit" it is.
          Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
           find a few Timberjacks in those
           woods? The odd Whispering Death or
           two in the rocks? Who knows...
           maybe we'll finally track down
           another Night Fury.

                          (BEAT)
           Wouldn't that be something?

                          (BURDENED)
           So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
          Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
          call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to
          see...

                         

          EXT. SEA STACK/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two)

                         
          ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs
          talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 11.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP
           `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you
           been?

                         
          Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
          rushes up to greet them.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Winning races. What else? The real
           question is... where have YOU been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Avoiding my dad.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, no. What happened now?

                         
          Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
          the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
          play fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
           up. The sun's shining. Terrible
           Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
           I saunter down to breakfast,
           thinking all is right with the
           world, and I get...

                         
          He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                          (APING STOICK)
           ... Son, we need to talk.

                         
          Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.

                          ASTRID

                          (APING HICCUP)
           Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
           of goofing off to get started.

                         
          Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay, first of all, I don't sound
           like that. What is this character?
           And second... what is that thing
           you're doing with my shoulders?

                         
          Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           A truly flattering impersonation.
           Anyway, he goes...
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're the pride of Berk, son, and
           I couldn't be prouder...

                         

                          ASTRID
           (continuing her impression

                          OF HICCUP)
           Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
           impressed with myself, too.

                         

                          HICCUP
           WHEN have I ever done that with my
           hands?

                         

                          ASTRID
           You just did.

                         
          She laughs, playfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay... just...
           (holding her arms, mock-

                          STERN)
           Hold still. It's very serious.

                         
          She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're all grown up, and since no
           chief could ask for a better
           successor, I've decided--

                         
          Astrid straightens, her face brightening.

                          ASTRID
           --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

                         
          She jumps to her feet, beaming...

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Hiccup, that's amazing!

                         
          And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the
          dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
          laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.

                         

                          HICCUP
           You're gonna wear out the spring
           coil. The calibration is very
           sensitive!

          They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah, so... this is what I'm
           dealing with.

                         
          Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXCITED)
           What did you tell him?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I didn't. By the time he turned
           around, I was gone.

                         
          Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
          processing it all.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Well, it's a lot of responsibility.
           The map will have to wait for sure,
           and I'll need to fly Toothless,
           since you'll be too busy...

                         
          She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
          knowingly, taking the map from her.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's not me, Astrid. All those
           speeches, and planning, and running
           the village... that's his thing.

                         

                          ASTRID
           I think you're missing the point. I
           mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be
           pretty excited.
          Hiccup shakes his head.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm not like you. You know exactly
           who you are. You always have.
           But...

                         
          He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm still looking. I know that I'm
           not my father... and I never met my
           mother... so, what does that make
           me?

          He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid
          approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out
          at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his
          hair as she speaks.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What you're searching for... isn't
           out there, Hiccup.

                         
          She places a hand on his chest.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           It's in here.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe you just don't see it yet.

                         
          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

                         
          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Maybe. But, y'know... there is
           something out there.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Hiccup...

                         
          He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises
          from a misty valley.

                         

                         

          EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)
          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
          undulating crimson and gold forests.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          FORT.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Stay close.

                         
          They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,
          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What happened here?

          It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an
          enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below,
          leaving him uneasy.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Easy, bud.

                         
          As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN
          at the stern of a moored ship below.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup!

                         

           ERET (O.S.)
           Fire!

                         
          The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls
          into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Astrid! Look out!

                         
          It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin
          uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE
          toward a collision.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HICCUP!

                         
          Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at
          the last second.

                         
          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

                         

                          ERET
           Watch the tail!

                         
          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes
          and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her
          down like a rodeo cowboy.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Tie those legs up!

                         
          Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into
          submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,
          revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that
          search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings
          out.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Is that what I think it is?

          Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and
          landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR.

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          ASTRID

           STORMFLY!
           (to the trappers)
           What are you doing?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward
          Stormfly.

                         
          Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and
          ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --
          impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

                         

                          ERET
           Back again?

                         
          Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Soil my britches... that is a Night
           Fury. Thought they were all gone
           for good.
           (to his fellow trappers)
           Looks like our luck's had a turn
           for the better, lads! Don't think
           Drago has one of those in his
           dragon army.

                         
          His men sound out in agreement. Hiccup eyes Astrid, confused.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Dragon army?

                          HICCUP
           Look, we don't want any trouble.

                         

                          ERET
           Ha! You should've thought of that
           before you stole all of our dragons
           and blasted our fort to bits!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wait...

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you talking about?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup take in the icy destruction, putting it
          together.

           You think we did this?

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon trapping is hard enough work
           as it is, without do-gooder dragon
           riders sneaking in to rescue them.

                         

                          HICCUP
           What do-gooder -- there are other
           dragon riders?

                         

                          ERET
           You mean, other than your thieving
           friend from last night? You tell
           me.

                         
          Eret approaches. Toothless snarls, protectively.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You may have an ice-spitting dragon
           on your side, but we still have a
           quota to fill. How do you suppose
           we explain this mess to Drago
           Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Drago what-fist? Does anything you
           say make sense?

                         

                          TEENY
           He's expecting a new shipment of
           dragons for his army by tomorrow.

                         

                          NO-NAME
           And Drago don't take well to
           excuses.
          Eret parts his tunic, revealing a large branding-iron scar on
          his torso, in the shape of a dragon skull, split by a sword.

                         

                          ERET
           This is what he gave me last time I
           showed up empty-handed. He promised
           to be far less understanding in the
           future.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Look, we don't know anything about
           a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting
           dragon, or your lunatic boss and
           his dragon army, okay?

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Just give us back our dragon, and
           we'll go, strange, hostile person
           whom we've never met.

                         
          Eret bows playfully.

                         

                          ERET
           Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret.
           Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper
           alive.

                         
          He pulls a dagger from behind his back, waving it cockily.
          His men ready their weapons and net cannons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           After all, it's not just anyone who
           can capture a Night Fury.

                         
          Toothless ROARS a warning.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And this is Toothless. He says
           we're going. Now.

                         

                          ERET
           Heh. They all say that.

                          (BEAT)

           RUSH `EM, LADS!

                         
          Eret lunges toward them. Toothless BLASTS, bringing down a
          massive spire of ice. It shatters as it hits the ground,
          forcing Eret and his men to dive out of the way.

                         
          Making quick use of the distraction, Hiccup re-ignites his
          dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding Stormfly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!

                         
          Eret gets to his feet in time to see Toothless and Stormfly
          take to the air, carrying Hiccup and Astrid out of reach of
          the volley of arrows.

                         

                          ERET

           YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE

           DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS

           COMING FOR THEM ALL!

          The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her
          assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as
          they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down
          to...

                         
          THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their
          dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL,
          awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd,
          spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing.

                         
          He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a
          metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently,
          his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head
          watches, sympathetically.

                         

                          STOICK
           Any sign of him?

                         
          Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area
          of unsoiled skin.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's probably flown off the
           edge of the world by now. You sure
           you want that kid running the
           village? You can still delay your
           retirement.

                         

                          STOICK
           Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

                         
          A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's
          return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Haha! There he is!
           (to Gobber, proving his

                          POINT)
           Huh? The pride of Berk!

                         
          Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Who finally decided to show up for
           work. Yay.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Sorry. Got held up.
           (privately, to Stoick)
           Hey, Dad, could I have a word?

                         

                          STOICK
           Something you're itching to tell
           me?

                          HICCUP
           Not quite the itch you're thinking
           of, but yes.

                         
          Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk.

                         

                          STOICK
           Good man! Now, lesson one. A
           chief's first duty is to his
           people. So...

                         
          Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Forty one? Forty --

                         

                          HICCUP
           Could we just talk in private for--

                         

                          STARKARD
           --That's me! That's me! I'm next!
           (pushing his way through)
           I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've
           been here all day!

                         
          STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement.

                         

                          STARKARD (CONT'D)
           Okay, I want one of those high
           seaters, with lots of spikes and a
           big stowage compartment.

                         

                          STOICK
           Absolutely! You got it, sir!

                         
          Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop.

                          HICCUP
           Dad, this is actually a little more
           important than building saddles.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too
           small when it comes to serving your
           people. Excuse us, Grump.

                         
          They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon,
          stirring him awake with a fussy start.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Grump! You let the forge die down
           again!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21.

                         

                         
          Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It
          splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side-
          steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall.
          Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's it, Grump. You're going up
           for adoption!

                         
          Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench.

                         

                          STOICK
           One of these. And this...

                         

                          HICCUP

                          DAD --

                         

                          STOICK
           -- There you go! Go on. Have away.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But, seriously, I really need to
           tell you about this new land we
           came across.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Another one?!

                         
          Fishlegs walks in, followed by the Twins and Snotlout.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Any new dragons?

                         
          Stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold, and hands
          Hiccup pencil. Exasperated, Hiccup begins tracing an outline
          as he speaks.

                          HICCUP
           We didn't stick around to find out.
           These folks weren't particularly
           friendly.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, really? Your Night Fury and
           Deadly Nadder didn't bring them
           cheering to the rooftops?

                         
          Gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, this was different. Not the
           standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha
           I've come to enjoy. These guys were
           trappers. Dragon trappers.

                          ASTRID
           You should've seen their fort. All
           blown apart and stuck in giant
           spikes of ice. It was weird.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I've never seen anything like it.
           And worst of all, they thought we
           did it!

                         
          Gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush
          from his dispenser...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Y'know, you two are gonna get
           yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one
           of these days. Not everyone
           appreciates this way of life.

                         
          Which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows.

                         
          Stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw...

                         

                          STOICK
           Gobber's right, son. Best we keep
           to our own. Besides, you'll have
           more important uses for your time --

                         
          And pulls a lever, starting it up.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           (sing-songy, under his

                          BREATH)
           Once we make the big announcement!

                         
          Hiccup pulls the lever, shutting the saw down.

                          HICCUP
           They are building a dragon army.

                         
          Silence fills the stall. Vikings exchange worried glances.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Or at least the guy they work for
           is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.

                         
          Stoick's eyes widen. He turns to Gobber, with growing alarm.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           I'll bloody his fist with my face
           if he tries to take my dragon!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Or mine.

                          TUFFNUT
           You're such a moron.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           A beautiful moron.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Yeah...

                         
          Ruffnut grumbles, revolted by their advances.

                         
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the shoulders, wide-eyed and intense.

                         

                          STOICK
           Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?

                         

                         

          INT. BERK - DRAGON STABLES - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast,
          bustling cave that houses the dragon stables.

                         

                          STOICK

           GROUND ALL DRAGONS!

                         

                          HICCUP
           What? Why?!

                         
          Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.

                         

                          STOICK

           SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM

           DOORS!

                          HICCUP
           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is
           happening?

                         

                          GOBBER
           You heard the man! Lock it down!

                         
          Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're
          lowered.

                         

                          STOICK
           No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off
           this island until I give the word!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP
           Because some guy you knew is
           stirring up trouble in some faraway
           land?

                         
          Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.

                         

                          STOICK
           Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.
           Without conscience or mercy. And if
           he's built a dragon army... gods
           help us all.

                         
          Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Get them into their pens! Quickly!

                         
          Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Then let's ride back out there.
           We'll follow those trappers to
           Drago and talk some sense into him.

                         

                          STOICK
           No. We fortify the island.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's our duty to keep the peace!

                         

                          STOICK
           Peace is over, Hiccup. I must
           prepare you for war.

                         

                          HICCUP
           War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our
           dragons, we can't wait around for
           him to get here. Let's go find him
           and change his mind.

                         

                          STOICK
           Some minds won't be changed,
           Hiccup. Berk is what you need to
           worry about.

                          (BEAT)
           A chief protects his own.

                         
          Stoick heads off, calling out more orders...

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY

           STALL!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25.

                         

                         
          ... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close.
          Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup, don't.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I have to.

                         
          He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.

                         

                          STOICK

           THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

           HICCUP!

                         
          They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Come on!

                         
          Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the
          second lowering storm door.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the
          storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.

                         

                         

          EXT. OPEN SEA - MIDDAY


                         
          (Scene 0700 - Eret's Lesson)
          Eret's ship carves a defiant path North, leaving the last
          glimpses of Lapland in its wake.

                         
          Eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently,
          searching the surface. He turns toward the deck, where his
          crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.

                         

                          ERET
           Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With
           this wind, we'll reach Drago by
           daybreak, so best we fill this ship
           up with dragons and quick! It's no
           time to be picky. Not if we want to
           keep our --
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.

                         

                         

                          UG
           Uh... Eret?

                         
          Eret turns in the direction Ug is pointing to see a pair of
          dragons flapping toward them.

                         

                          ERET

           HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!

                         
          The crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back-lit,
          silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Net `em, lads! Take `em down!

                         
          Eret loads a cannon and takes aim. He spots Hiccup and Astrid
          riding the dragons. His eyes narrow, determined.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           You're not getting away this time.

                         
          Nets fly through the air. Hiccup and Astrid outmaneuver them
          and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           And here I was worried we might
           turn up empty-handed.

                         
          Astrid brandishes her axe in invitation. Hiccup indicates for
          her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Nope. It's your lucky day. We give
           up.

                         
          Eret's crew exchange confused stares. As does Astrid.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That's one Night Fury, one Deadly
           Nadder, and...

                         
          He dismounts Toothless and tosses a net over Astrid.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           ... two of the finest dragon riders
           west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make
           the boss happy, right?

                         
          Astrid grumbles. He takes her axe, hands it to Eret, and
          escorts Astrid past the men to the open live well.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Excuse us.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.

                         

                         
          He leads Astrid down the ladder. She glares at him, plainly
          hating the plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?

                         
          Toothless tries to follow them, but Hiccup holds him back.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless, stay.

                         
          Hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as Eret watches,
          confounded.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           The dragons don't really care for
           cramped spaces, so they'll just
           hang out with you. They won't be
           any trouble.

                         
          Eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward
          Toothless. HE SNARLS.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Unless you do that. Wooden boat,
           big ocean. How's your swimming?

                         

                          NO-NAME
           Not good.

                         
          A burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the
          crewmen to jump back. Hiccup thrusts his Dragon Blade through
          the grate.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have
           armed prisoners!

                          ASTRID
           How is this a plan?

                         
          He retracts the blade and offers it up. A crewman cautiously
          takes it, looking it over. The pommel of the hilt is
          expelling green gas.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Just what every dragon trapper
           needs. One end coats the blade in
           Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The
           other sprays Hideous Zippleback
           gas. All it takes is a spark and...

                         
          A curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas.
          Hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, yeah, there you go!

                         
          Toothless paws at the embers.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Once they see you as one of their
           own, even the testiest dragons can
           be trained, right, bud?

                         
          Toothless gurgles and falls over.

                         

                          ERET
           Give me that!

                         
          Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard.
          Stormfly bolts after it...

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           What game are you playing?

                         

                          HICCUP
           No game. We just want to meet
           Drago.

                         
          And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a
          fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again,
          frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly.

                         

                          ERET
           Why?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Because I'm going to change his
           mind about dragons.

                         
          Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well.

                          ASTRID
           He can be really persuasive.

                         
          Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Once you've earned his loyalty,
           there is nothing a dragon won't do
           for you.

                         

                          ERET
           Puh! You won't be changing any
           minds around here.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP
           I can change yours. Right here.
           Right now.

                         
          Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position.
          Eret sneers, suspicious.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           May I?

                         
          Suddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past.

          (Scene 1000 - Botched Rescue)

                         
          The crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS
          streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through
          rigging.

                         

                          ERET
           Dragon riders!

                         
          Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in
          the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes,
          realizing that it's Hookfang.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Put me down! Snotlout! What are you
           doing?

                         
          Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           See how well I protect and provide?
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET
          whizzes past her head.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Aggh! What is with all the nets?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey watch it! That was close...

                         
          Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship.

          A SLOW MOTION, sexy POV of Eret's glistening biceps,
          shuddering as he BLASTS the net cannon, aimed directly at
          her.

           Oh, my.

                         
          The net unravels in SLOW MOTION...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Me likey.

                         
          ... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully.

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Take me.

                         

          BACK TO REAL TIME

                         
          As Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and
          KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps.

                         
          Eret takes aim, but Astrid SHOVES him, throwing off the shot.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                         
          Hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with
          its sail. He slides down the canvas and drops to the deck.
          Toothless lands behind him.

                         

                          HICCUP

           WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!

                         
          Gobber and Grump land on the deck, scattering Eret's crew.

                         

                          GOBBER
           We're here to RESCUE you!

                         

                          HICCUP
           I DON'T NEED to be rescued!

           STOICK (O.S.)

           ENOUGH!

                         
          The bow dips heavily as Stoick touches down on SKULLCRUSHER.
          He dismounts, fuming.

                         
          Eret blocks Stoick, cocky and confident.

                         

                          ERET
           Well, didn't you just pick the
           wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --

                         
          Stoick shoves his face aside, sending Eret SLAMMING into
          Grump. Before he can react, Gobber CLUBS Eret on the head,
          sending him collapsing to the deck. Grump then sits on him,
          smothering him into submission.

           Get... this... thing... off... me!

                         
          Gobber turns to the other crewmen, with a smile.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Anyone else?

                         
          Eret's men eye the Vikings, armed and flanked by their
          dragons. They set down their swords.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           That's what I figured.

                         

                          STOICK

           You. Saddle up. We're going home.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          HICCUP
           -- I'm trying to protect our
           dragons and stop a war! How is that
           irresponsible?

          Hiccup glares, frustrated.

                         
          Stoick SIGHS, realizing that he has to explain.

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Years ago, there was a great
           gathering of chieftains to discuss
           the dragon scourge we all faced.

          A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit
          hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains.
          His face is masked in silhouette.

           STOICK (V.O.)
           Into our midst came a stranger from
           a strange land, covered in scars
           and draped in a cloak of dragon
           skin. He carried no weapon and
           spoke softly, saying that he, Drago
           Bludvist, was a man of the people,
           devoted to freeing mankind from the
           tyranny of dragons.

                         
          ON STOICK, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne,
          studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           He claimed that he alone could
           control the dragons and that he
           alone could keep us safe, if we
           chose to bow down and follow him.

                         
          The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter.

                         

          BACK TO PRESENT

                         
          Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the Twins snicker.

                          TUFFNUT
           Good one.

                         

                          STOICK
           Aye. We laughed, too...

                         

          BACK TO FLASHBACK

           Until he wrapped himself in his
           cloak and cried out, "Then see how
           well you do without me!"

                         
          Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and
          marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the
          ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons
          covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic
          ensues.

                         

           STOICK (V.O.)
           The rooftop suddenly burst into
           flames, and from it, armored
           dragons descended, burning the hall
           to the ground.

           Maybe.

                         
          Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret
          watches intently.

                         

                          STOICK

           I'm still going to try.

                         
          Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is what I'm good at. And if I
           could change your mind... I can
           change his, too.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           Come on.

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone
          stirring in awkward silence.

                         
          Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him.

                          ASTRID
           Let's go.

           NO! Lead the others back to Berk.
           I've had enough mutiny for one day.

                         
          Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward
          Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily
          fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.

                         

                          RUFFNUT

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          (Scene 1100 - Ambushed!)
          Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a
          bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun.
          Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle.
          Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam
          from their breath mixes in the frigid air.

                          HICCUP
           Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let
           anything happen to you. I promise.
          Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder
          to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds.
          A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds,
          standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in
          the buffeting turbulence.
          The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside
          them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery
          and sits up, flustered.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?!
          He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape.
          The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity
          while cutting a menacing silhouette.
          Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back
          beneath the clouds, disappearing.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           Okay.

                          (TO TOOTHLESS)
           No sudden moves.
          Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them,
          standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and
          Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR.

                         
          The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he
          returns to face them.

           Hold on, hold on.
          Toothless GROWLS a warning.
          Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off
          of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!
          With the tail unmanned, Toothless PLUMMETS helplessly. He
          FLAPS wildly then CRASHES through the ice into the black,
          frigid water. FLAILING and CRYING OUT, he struggles to stay
          afloat as he watches...
          Hiccup disappear into the night sky, carried off in the
          talons of the strange dragon -- one of TENS that accompany
          the warrior in a cavalcade.
          Toothless BELLOWS in distress, desperately trying to take to
          the air. As he LEAPS and CRASHES, time and again...
          A group of SPINY DORSAL FINS split the ice, carving a path
          toward Toothless.
          Beneath the ice, a pod of SEASHOCKERS approach, two-headed,
          with Manta Ray like wings GLIDING silently in the gloom.
          Fixated on Hiccup, Toothless is caught by surprise as the
          Seashockers surface and DRAG HIM UNDER.
          Hiccup's helmet bobs to the surface, marking all that
          remains.

                         

                         

          EXT. ARCTIC SKY/ARCHIPELAGO - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN)

          (Scene 1300 - Dragon Lady)

                         
          Hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon, surrounded by the
          strange flock full of breeds he's never seen. He looks back
          for Toothless, now long gone.

                         

                          HICCUP

           HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!

           HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL

           DROWN!

                         
          The warrior offers no response, seemingly immune to the cold
          as he leads the dragon flock across the polar night -- an
          alien landscape, harsh and foreboding.

          Out of the fog looms an EPIC ICE FORMATION -- jagged, spiked,
          and similar to the icy aftermath of Eret's fort, but many
          times its size.

                         
          The DRAGON ESCORT dives into its jagged folds.

                         

                         

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL, CAVERNOUS
          CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock. It's heavily
          populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows.

                         
          Hiccup is dropped in the center. He scrambles to his feet,
          calling out into the darkness.

                         

                          HICCUP
           We have to head back for my dragon!

                         
          A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive.

                         
          Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade,
          waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses,
          intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies
          him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade.

                         
          The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.

                         
          Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing
          their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a
          cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a
          perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the
          lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil.

                         
          He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.
          The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.

          ON THE WARRIOR

                         
          ... tilting his masked head, curious. He dismounts his dragon
          and approaches Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Who are you? The Dragon Thief?
           Drago Bludvist?

                         
          The warrior circles Hiccup in silence, taking in his gear,
          his dragon blade, his face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Do you even understand what I'm
           saying?

          The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff. In response, a
          large dragon ASCENDS from the depths, carrying...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless!

                         
          Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup, sopping
          wet. Hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly.
          Toothless coos in relief.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I'm glad to see you,
           too, bud. You really had me worried
           there.

                         
          The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. In
          response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight
          from their throats, spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless.

                         
          The warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches
          Hiccup, cautiously and animal-like.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively, but then
          instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. With a
          quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in
          a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.

                         
          The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He
          recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on
          Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.

                         
          The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.

                         

                          WARRIOR
           (whispered, shaken)
           Hiccup?

                          (BEAT)
           Could it be? After all these years?
           How is this possible?

                         
          The voice is surprisingly female.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, should I... should I know you?

                         

                          WARRIOR
           No. You were only a babe...

                         
          The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA,
          40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA

          Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

          Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap
          against the pack ice.

                         

                          STOICK
           Boar-headed! Just like his mother!
           She could never stay put either.

                         
          Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow
          furrowed and solemn.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking.
           I mean, could there be a worse
           combination? Ha! When I think of
           how stubborn and senseless YOU were
           back in the day... well, not much
           has changed, actually.

                         

                          STOICK
           You know what he's like. He won't
           give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup
           finds Drago, before we find him...

                         

                          GOBBER
           Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so
           long as that Night Fury's around.
           It's a Night Fury!
          Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the
          surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading
          Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the
          water. It's Hiccup's helmet.

                         
          Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread.
          Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL.

                         

                          STOICK
           Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him.

                         
          Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and
          suddenly CHANGES HEADING.

                          HICCUP

           You can't just say something like
           that and run off! You're my
           mother?! I mean, what the -- do you
           grasp how INSANE it sounds?!

                          (BEAT)

          Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to
          clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Where have you been all this time?

                         
          Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          Hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a
          dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate,
          filled with dragons of every shape and kind.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You've been rescuing them.

                          HICCUP
           What? No. I don't know. It's a bit
           much to get my head around, to be
           frank. It's not every day you find
           out your mother is some kind of
           crazy, feral, vigilante dragon
           lady.

                         
          Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself
          to the ground like a skilled acrobat.

                         

                          VALKA
           At least I'm not boring... right?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I suppose there is that...
           (feeble, trailing off)
           ... one... specific... thing...

                         
          Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup
          pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.

                         

                          VALKA

           I don't have the words.

                         
          Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering
          dragons SNIFF every part of him.

                         

                          VALKA
           Can I... ? He's beautiful!

                         
          She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch.

           Incredible. He might very well be
           the last of his kind.

                         
          She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back,
          nuzzling her.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And look, he's your age! No wonder
           you get along so well.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka.
          She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch.

                          HICCUP
           --I found him in the woods. He was
           shot down and wounded.

                         
          She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to
          caress a few of her own rescued dragons.

                         

                          VALKA
           This Snafflefang lost his leg to
           one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.
           This Raincutter had her wing sliced
           by razor netting. And this poor
           Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree
           snare... then left to die alone and
           scared.
           (re: Toothless' tail)
           And what of this? Did Drago or his
           trappers do this, too?

                          HICCUP
           Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm
           actually the one who shot him down.

                         
          She glares, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's okay though. He got me back.
           (playfully, to Toothless)
           Right, bud? You couldn't save all
           of me, could you? You just had to
           make it even. So... peg leg!

                         
          Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka
          observes their playful rapport with curiosity.

                          VALKA
           What did your father think of your
           Night Fury friend?

                         

                          HICCUP
           He didn't take it all that well.

                         
          She mutters in agreement.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But then... he changed. They all
           did. Pretty soon everyone back home
           had dragons of their own.

                         
          She smiles at Toothless, dismissive.

                         

                          VALKA
           If only it were possible.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No, really, I --

                         

                          VALKA
           -- Believe me, I tried, as well.

           change, Hiccup. Some of us... were
           just born different.

                         FLASHBACK

                         
          Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep
          and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           Berk was a land of kill or be
           killed, but I believed peace was
           possible.

                         
          A Viking is about to finish off a felled dragon, but Valka
          chases up to him and tugs at his arm.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stop! You'll only make it worse!

                         
          The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety... leaving the
          Viking warrior glaring at Valka.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           It was a very unpopular opinion.

          As he rushes off, Valka hears a clatter and whirls around to
          see a DRAGON (Cloudjumper) clawing its way through the roof
          of a house.

                         

                          VALKA
           Hiccup!

                         FLASHBACK CONTINUED

                         
          Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof,
          sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner.

                         
          Valka rushes in, panicked.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           One night, a dragon broke into our
           house, finding you in the cradle.

                         
          Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only
          to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY
          HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           I rushed to protect you, but what I
           saw... was proof of everything I
           believed.

                         
          Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.
          Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally
          SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.

                         
          Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.

                         

           VALKA (V.O.)
           This wasn't a vicious beast, but an
           intelligent, gentle creature, whose
           soul reflected my own.

                         
          Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely
          missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.

                         

                          STOICK
           Valka, run!

                         
          Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS!

                         
          Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the
          wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.

                         
          The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold.

                          VALKA
           Don't!

                         
          It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.

                         

                          STOICK
           Hold on!

                         
          Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him
          out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar...

                         

           VALKA (O.S.)
           No! Stoick!

                         
          ... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka
          are GONE.

                         

                          STOICK

          Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits
          Valka away into the night sky.

                         

                          STOICK

          ON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin...

                          VALKA
           You and your father nearly died
           that night, all because I couldn't
           kill a dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah, it runs in the family.

                         

                          VALKA
           It broke my heart to stay away, but
           I believed you'd be safer if I did.

          Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing
          the sting of remorse.

                         

                          HICCUP
           How did you survive?

                         

                          VALKA
           Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm
           me. He must've thought I belonged
           here...

                         
          She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace,
          overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring
          waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive
          white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests
          benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that
          of a lion surrounded by his pride.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           In the home of the great
           Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.
           One of very few that still exist.

                          (BEAT)
           Every nest has its queen, but this
           is king of all dragons.

                         
          Dragons land and bow reverentially to the Bewilderbeast.
          Valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a
          sweating greenhouse.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           With his icy breath, this graceful
           giant built our nest. A safe haven
           for dragons everywhere.

                         
          On HICCUP, putting it together.

                          HICCUP
           Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's
           responsible for all that
           destruction?

                         

                          VALKA
           He protects us. We all live under
           his care. And his command.

                         
          They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out
          of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless
          is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching.
          Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

          The hatchlings clamber on top of the Bewilderbeast and play
          on his massive tusks, despite his authority. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           ... who listen to no one.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast lets out a frosty SNORT, sending off the
          youngsters to spread more mischief.

                         
          Now awakened, The Bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to
          take a closer look at Hiccup, coming eye to massive eye.
          Valka bows in his presence. As does Toothless.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I've lived among them for twenty
           years, Hiccup, learning their ways,
           discovering their secrets...

                         
          He acknowledges Hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back
          Hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. Valka laughs.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           He likes you.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Wow.

                         
          She chuckles, delighting in his awe.

                         

                          VALKA
           You must be hungry.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, yeah. I could eat.

                         

                          VALKA
           Good. It's feeding time.
          Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to
          befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He
          grimaces and follows Valka out.

           What if Drago shot them down? What
           if they need our help?

                          (RESOLUTE)
           We have to find them.

                         

                          FISHLEGS

           What? But Stoick said...

                         

                          ASTRID
           It doesn't matter what he said, if
           they've all been captured. Come on!

                         
          She flies off, determined.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE FLOES - NIGHT


                         
          Eret's ship is beset by ice floes. The crew stirs on deck as
          he paces, grumbling, while nursing his head with a large
          chunk of ice.

                          NO-NAME
           Do we go back?

                         

                          ERET
           We've nowhere to go! Nothing to
           sell! And no heads to call our own,
           if we don't turn up with dragons
           and fast --

                         
          He's suddenly scooped up in Stormfly's talons.

           A kidnapping.

                         
          Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he?
           Can he?

                         
          Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You're gonna show us the way to

                          ASTRID
           That can be arranged. Stormfly,
           drop it.

                         
          In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons,
          sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles
          toward the ice far below.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.

                         
          She dives after him, just as enthusiastically.
          ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him.

          Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just
          before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her
          knuckles.

          (Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy)

                         

                         BEGIN MONTAGE

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a
          majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun.

                         
          Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of
          dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on
          their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hey, I thought we were going to
           eat?

                         

                          VALKA
           (with a mischievous grin)
           Oh, we are.

                         
          She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the
          fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense
          shoal of fish near the surface.

                         
          Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping
          the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface.
          It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a
          fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing
          back down into the sea.

                         
          Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race
          for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup
          gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a
          mouth full.

                         

          EXT. SNOWY SHORELINE - LATER


                         

          MONTAGE CONTINUES...

                         
          Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the
          various lands he's discovered during his explorations.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And from Dragon Island, I found
           this archipelago...

                         
          He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but
          she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in
          the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has
          explored.

          She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement
          is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over
          Valka's map with a giant icicle.

                         
          Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper
          sneers.

                         

                         

          EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER


                         
          Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a
          strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff.

                         
          One by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong
          updraft, popping their wings open like kites. They ride the
          wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric
          dance. It's clearly a form of dragon play.

                         
          Hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind,
          laughs giddily as he watches Valka walk across Cloudjumper's
          wing and onto several others, dragon-hopping from one to
          another, until she gracefully crosses Toothless from wing tip
          to wing tip. She then drops out of sight, reappearing a
          moment later standing atop Cloudjumper. Hiccup is in utter
          awe of her.

                         
          Valka breathes in the frigid air. Lets it out blissfully.

                         

                          VALKA
           When I'm up here, I don't even feel
           the cold. I just feel...

                         

                          HICCUP
           Free.

                         
          She smiles at Hiccup. He gleams back.

                          VALKA
           This is what it is to be a dragon,
           Hiccup.

                         
          Hiccup LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position and
          unbuckles himself. Valka watches, curious.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's all well and good to call
           yourself a dragon.

                         
          Hiccup RUNS OFF of Toothless, pulling his stowed wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           But can you fly?

                         
          They catch the air, SNAPPING OPEN... and sending him GLIDING.

          Valka GASPS, astonished. She flies her dragon alongside him,
          marvelling, as...

                         
          ... Hiccup SOARS, riding the wild air currents like an eagle,
          the image of freedom. Toothless descends steadily with him,
          hovering protectively.

                         
          Hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed Valka... until he
          realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with
          a fast approaching mountain top.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh no. Toothless!

                         
          But, with his tail locked, Toothless can't make the tight
          jackknife turn skyward to rescue Hiccup.

                         
          Realizing that they're in trouble, Valka and Cloudjumper pour
          on the speed. All four of them collide just as they reach the
          mountain top, sending them crash-landing in an explosion of
          snow.

                         
          They all TOPPLE head over tail to a messy landing on the wind-
          swept ridge and pop up LAUGHING.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Man! Almost! We just about had it
           that time!

                         
          Toothless raises his snow-packed face, glowering. He tail-
          swipes Hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder.

                         
          Valka inspects Hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.

                         

                          VALKA
           Incredible.

                          HICCUP
           Well, not bad yourself.

                         
          She caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. Hiccup
          doesn't recoil this time.

                         

                          VALKA
           All this time, you took after me.
           And where was I?

                          (REMORSEFUL)
           I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start
           over? Will you give me another
           chance?

                         
          Hiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I can teach you all I've learned,
           these past twenty years. Like...

                         
          Valka finds a spot at the top of Toothless' neck and rubs in
          a circular pattern. In response, his dorsal blades slowly
          crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic
          `V' down the length of his back and tail.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now you can make those tight turns.

                         
          Toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much-needed
          chiropractic adjustment. He bounds over to Hiccup, giddily
          retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a
          new toy.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Did YOU know about this?

                         
          Valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.

                         

                          VALKA
           Every dragon has its secrets.

                         
          Toothless pounces around, showing off to Cloudjumper, who
          seems thoroughly unimpressed.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           And I'll show them all to you.
           We'll unlock every mystery, find
           every last species, together, as
           mother and son.

                          (BEAT)
           This gift we share, Hiccup... it
           bonds us. This is who you are, son.
           Who we are. We will change the
           world for all dragons! We will make
           it a better, safer place!

                         

                          HICCUP
           That sounds... amazing.

                         
          She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion.
          Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before
          Hiccup peels away from her.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is so great! Now you and I can
           go talk to Drago -- together!

                         
          She chuckles, incredulous.

                          VALKA
           What? There's no talking to Drago.

                         

                          HICCUP
           But we have to --

                         

                          VALKA
           -- No. We must protect our own.

                         
          Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper
          lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like
          energy. Valka pets him.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Now come on, we should be getting
           back.

                         
          Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next
          to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin,
          clapping his dorsal blades.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE CAVE - DAY


                         
          (Scene 1350 - Meet Drago)

                         
          Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular
          icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a
          maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can
          flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg.

                         

                          ERET
           Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now
           get this thing off me!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Never take a toy from a dragon.
           Don't you know anything?

                         
          Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.

                         

                          ERET

                          (STRAINED)
           Gah! Why does this keep happening
           to me?

                         
          Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal...

                         
          A MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in
          the deep water between collided icebergs.

                         
          Thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of
          bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the
          ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan.

                          ASTRID
           What's down there?

                         
          Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt
          pouch.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Large diameter bubbles, massive
           lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm
           thinking class five leviathan,
           maybe six.

                         
          Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and
          takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the
          other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the
          ground, unconscious. Drugged.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?

                         
          Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the
          Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in
          polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're
          outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          DRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin
          cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship,
          adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face
          is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks.

                         

           ERET (O.S.)

           DRAGO!

                         
          Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly
          escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Get off me!

                         
          In the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug,
          Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck
          by armored dragons.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Always great to see you, my friend!
           Keeping warm up here?

                         
          The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago
          approaches.

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Well, as you can see, I'm right on
           time with a new batch of dragons,
           just like I promised.

                         
          Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow-
          dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.

                         

                          SOLDIER #1
           Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him
           steady!

                         

                          SOLDIER #2
           Give me some backup here!

                         

                          DRAGO
           Drop the ropes.

                         
          They do so. Hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the
          soldiers, then focusing on Drago as he closes in. The armored
          dragons avert their eyes and cower as Drago passes.

                         
          Hookfang HISSES a warning, but Drago approaches, undaunted.

                         
          Hookfang BLASTS. In a blur, Drago wraps himself in his dragon
          skin cloak. The sticky, napalm-like fire splatters against
          the fireproof scales, enveloping Drago in dripping flames as
          he persists forward without missing a step.

                         
          As the blast ends, Drago drops the cloak, closing in and
          holding a cold stare. Hookfang lets out a ferocious ROAR.

                         
          Drago YELLS back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting
          Hookfang and causing him to recoil. Drago whirls his bull-
          hook overhead and STABS it into the deck planks.

                         
          Hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of Drago's
          unflinching show of dominance.

                         
          After a moment, Hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head
          in submission. Drago places his boot upon Hookfang's snout,
          pressing it into the deck planks.

                          RUFFNUT
           Hey!

                         

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing?
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.

                         

                         

                          DRAGO
           (quiet, to the dragon)
           You belong to me now.

                         

                          ERET
           And as an added bonus, I also
           caught you their riders. No extra
           charge.

                         
          Drago notices the saddle on Hookfang's back. His eyes wander
          to the saddle on Meatlug. Alarm flashes in Drago's eyes.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What?! Are you kidding me?!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           But you were so perfect!

                         

                          ERET
           Turns out, there's a whole bunch of
           them out there. They --

                         
          In a flash, Drago stops toward Eret and seizes him by the
          throat.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How many?

                         
          As Eret chokes, stammering, Astrid whispers to the gang.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Drago doesn't have them after all.

                         

                          DRAGO

           HOW MANY?!

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hundreds! A whole island full!

                         
          His grip tightens around Eret's neck as he turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           I wouldn't worry about it. My men
           are hunting them down as we speak.
           They won't know where you're
           hiding. I promise you that.

                         
          Astrid nods a covert signal to the Gang -- she has a plan.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, yes they will!

                         
          Drago drops Eret as Astrid advances, staring Drago down. Eret
          tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use.

           They know we're missing and they

           much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna

                          ERET
           He's not a problem. Really. Trust
           me.

                         

                          ASTRID
           He's only the son of Stoick the
           Vast...

                         
          Drago's eyes narrow upon hearing Stoick's name.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           Nope.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Sorry!

                         

                          ASTRID
           And unless you let us go, right
           now, he will blast through here on
           his Night Fury and blow your entire
           fleet of ships to splinters!

                         
          Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.

           Good one, babe!

                         
          Ruffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances.

           Yeah. Like babies. They always cry.
           Real tiny ones...

                         
          Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him.

                         

                          DRAGO
           First there was one rider. And now
           all of Berk.

                          (TO ERET)
           And YOU led them to me.

                         
          He THROWS Eret across the deck.

                         

                          ERET
           Drago!

                         

                          DRAGO

           CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST

           ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT

           ONCE!

                          (SAVORING IT)

           WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA...

           AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK!

                         
          Soldiers CHEER in the thousands.

                         

                          ERET
           You're overreacting!

                         

                          DRAGO
           And get rid of him.

           Drago, please...

                         
          The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret...
          But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from
          the flurry of blades. She whips her tail, throwing spikes in
          all directions.

           STORMFLY!

                         
          Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings,
          until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her
          down...

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)

           NO!

                         
          Revealing Eret, gawking in shock.

          INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - MORNING


                         
          (Scene 1800 - Family Reunion)

                         
          Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge
          overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several
          babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps.

                         

                          HICCUP

                          (DETERMINED)
           Well, bud, we can't wait around for
           Drago to attack this place. We've
           gotta find him first. Let's go.

                         
          Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face --
          muffling his scream!

                         
          Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup.
          He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK
           Easy now.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Are you kidding me? How'd you get
           in here?

                         

                          STOICK
           The same way we're getting you out.

                         

                          HICCUP
           We?

                         
          Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.

                         

                          GOBBER
           All clear!

                          STOICK
           Toothless. Come.

                         
          They hurry back into the winding corridor.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad! There's something you need to
           know!

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           This isn't an on-the-way kind of
           update, actually...
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.

                         

                         

                          STOICK
           I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP
           ... more of the earth-shattering
           development variety.

                         

                          STOICK
           Yeah, just add it to the pile.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
           on you, this is one you'll like. I
           promise! You just have to handle it
           delicately, so...

                         
          They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber
          staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He
          shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Uh, you might want to take this
           one. Oh, boy.

                         
          Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Dad, can you put the sword away...
           please?

                         
          Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with
          a clatter.

                         
          Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the
          path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.

                         
          He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless
          appear at Stoick's side.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (RATTLED)
           I know what you're going to say,
           Stoick. How could I have done this?
           Stayed away all of these years. And
           why didn't I come back to you? To
           our son.

                         
          Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons
          emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Well, what sign did I have that you
           could change, Stoick? That anyone
           on Berk could?

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           I pleaded so many times to stop the
           fighting, to find another answer,
           but did any of you listen?

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is why I never married.

                          (BEAT)
           This and one other reason.

                         
          Stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. With every
          step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an
          ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces
          away.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (TEARFUL)
           I know that I left you to raise
           Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd
           be better off without me. And I was
           wrong, I see that now, but...

                         
          Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go
           on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!

                         

                          STOICK
           You're as beautiful as the day I
           lost you.

                         
          His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She
          softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He
          caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his
          fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then
          gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind.
          Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.

                         

                         

          EXT. ICE CHANNEL - DAY


                         
          (Scene 1750 - Eret's Turn)

                         
          Drago's massive flagship leads the flotilla, pulled along
          forcefully by whatever's at the other end of the enormous
          chain.

                         
          Drago WHACKS the chain with his bullhook, spurring it
          forward.

                         

          ON DRAGO'S SHIP

          Eret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern,
          surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound.
          Spear tips pressed into their backs.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Could this day get any worse?

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, let me see. You'll jump into
           freezing cold water and then die
           from drowning.

                         
          They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep,
          icy water below.

                         

                          ERET
           Looks refreshing.

                         
          He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Please, ladies first.

                         
          A pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You are a steaming heap of dragon --

                         

                          ERET
           -- Duck.

                         
          Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO
          DOWN, heavily.

                         
          He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and
          slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other
          spear, twirling both in invitation.

                          SOLDIER
           Warn the others!

                         
          One soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two
          raise BLOW DART TUBES.

                         
          Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into
          the neck of the second.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Get `em, you son of an Eret!

                         
          As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS
          OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight.

          Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and
          BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS,
          unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters.

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Okay, I love you again.

                         
          Ruffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout
          watches, crestfallen.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.

                         
          Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid.

                         

                          ERET
           So? Are we going to save your
           dragons and get out of here or not?

                         
          Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He
          reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier
          who took them and cuts Tuffnut free.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Check every trap. They're here
           somewhere.

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Astrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She
          peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug
          within, bound and chained to its base as bait.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Meatlug?

                         ON ERET

                         
          Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The
          iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK.

                         

                          ERET
           Anyone coming?

                         
          Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           I don't know. You just keep doing
           what you're doing. Keep crankin'...

                         
          Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly
          within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming
          immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly.

          Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle.

                         

                          ERET
           Thank you for saving my life.

           Now let me return the favor.

          (Scene 1850 - The Last Dance)

                         
          As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and
          Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her
          thoughts, and covering it up poorly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Mom, you'd never recognize it!
           Where we used to make weapons, we
           now build saddles, wing slings --
           we even fix dragon teeth! You
           wouldn't believe how much
           everything's changed!

                         
          Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.

                         

                          STOICK
           Our son's changed Berk for the
           better. I think we did well with
           this one, Val.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Thanks, Dad.

                         
          Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches,
          dropping the plate.
          Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it.
          Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper
          regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.

                         

                          VALKA
           I'm... a little out of practice.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SWEETLY)
           Well, y'know... I didn't marry you
           for your cooking.

                         

                          GOBBER
           (to Hiccup and Grump)
           I hope not. Her meatballs could
           kill more beasts than a battle axe.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           I've still got a few knocking
           around in here. Ha ha!

                         
          Gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish
          skewers into Grump's mouth like a trash can.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And once you move back in, with all
           of your dragons, Drago won't even
           stand a chance. Everything will be
           okay!

                         
          Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon
          Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.

                         

                          STOICK
           Slow down, son. It's a lot to take
           in.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh. Gotcha.

                         
          Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back
          turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He
          decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar
          tune.

                         
          ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody.
          She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the
          flask.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, I love this one!

                         
          Stoick approaches her delicately.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (WHISPERED)
           Remember our song, Val?

                         
          Hiccup watches him, curious, as Stoick FUMBLES THROUGH THE
          FIRST VERSE of an old Viking courting song:

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING SOFTLY)
           I'll swim and sail on savage seas,
           with ne'er a fear of drowning. And
           gladly ride the waves of life, if
           you will marry me.

                         
          Valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.

                          (SINGING)
           No scorching sun, nor freezing cold

                          WILL --

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           -- will stop me on my journey!
           (catching himself,

                          EMBARRASSED)
           Sorry.

                         
          Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           If you will promise me your
           heart...

                         
          Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And love...

                         
          Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes
          her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-
          hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She
          softly SINGS HER PART:

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           And love me for eternity.

                         
          Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center
          of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.
          Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a
          beautiful dance to accompany the song.

                          VALKA (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           My dearest one, my darling dear,
           you mighty words astound me. But
           I've no need of mighty deeds, when
           I feel your arms around me.

                         
          The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka
          recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-
          struck eyes.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (SINGING)
           But I would bring you rings of
           gold. I'd even sing you poetry.

           And I would keep you from all harm,
           if you'd stay here beside me.

                         

                          VALKA

                          (SINGING)
           I have no use for rings of gold. I
           care not for your poetry. I only
           want your hand to hold. I only want
           you near me.

                         
          Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so
          that he can join in the dancing, too.

                         

                          GOBBER
           C'mon, Hiccup!

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.
           For the dancing and the dreaming.
           Through all life's sorrows and
           delights, I'll keep your love
           inside me.

                         
          Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning
          and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.

                         

           VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)

                          (SINGING)
           I'll swim and sail through savage
           seas, with ne'er a fear of
           drowning. And gladly ride the waves
           of life, if you will marry me!

                         
          Gobber carries the last note...

                         

                          GOBBER

                          (SINGING)
           I'm still going...

                         
          Hiccup taps him.

                          GOBBER
           I'm done.

                         
          Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.

                         

                          STOICK
           Ah... I thought I'd have to die
           before we'd have that dance again.

           No need for drastic measures.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

                         
          She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes
          down on one knee, proposing to her anew.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Will you come home, Val? Will you
           be my wife once again?

                         
          Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup
          joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           We can be a family! What do you
           say?

                         
          Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup.

                         

                          VALKA
           Yes!

                         
          Gobber pops his head in.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Great! I'll do the cooking!

                         
          They laugh.

                         

                          STOICK
           Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,
           son. We never would have found each
           other.
          Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing
          something unheard. Hiccup notices.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless?

                         
          Dragons SWARM past Valka's chamber, racing toward some
          unknown disturbance.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                         
          They're answered by subsequent HEAVY BOOMS that reverberate
          through the fortress.

          (Scene 1900 - Surprise Guests)

                         
          Valka rushes out to find...

                         
          DRAGO'S ARMADA in the lagoon below and his forces of
          thousands now landed upon the beach.

                         
          They launch catapults and ballistas into the icy spires,
          gaining entrance into the mountain's tunnels.

                         
          Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber catch up to Valka.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no...

                         
          Valka tries to hurry off, fuming. Stoick stops her.

                         

                          STOICK
           Val! It's all right, it's all
           right. We're a team now.

                          (BEAT)
           Now what do you want to do?

                         
          She glances from Hiccup to Stoick.

                         

                          VALKA
           We have to save the dragons.

                         

                          STOICK

                          (DETERMINED)
           Aye. You got it!

                         
          He throws an arm around Hiccup.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, son.

                         

          ON THE BATTLEFIELD

                         
          VALKA'S DRAGONS SWOOP down to engage the attackers, picking
          up soldiers and carrying them off while Drago stands in the
          line of fire, unflinching.

                         
          The catapults continue to bring down the icy defenses of
          dragon mountain. Drago's men pour into the tunnels. 

                         

                          DRAGO
           Whatever comes, keep hitting the
           mountain! We need to draw the alpha
           out.

          Drago's armored DRAGON ARMY takes wing, clashing with Valka's
          dragons in the skies.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Ready the traps!

                         
          Iron jaws are opened like bear traps, revealing screeching
          `bait' dragons within. Valka's dragons swoop down to rescue
          them, only to be SNAPPED UP in the fearsome jaws.

                         
          A second set of traps are cocked open, but instead of dragon
          cries, ZIPPLEBACK GAS seeps out... followed by an EXPLOSION.
          The TWINS rocket out of the trap, riding BARF and BELCH.

                         

                          TUFFNUT

                          DRAGO

           WHAT?!

                         
          They're joined by Astrid and the rest of the GANG, bursting
          out of the traps atop Meatlug and Hookfang.

                         
          Eret comes flying out last, WAILING aboard Stormfly. He
          struggles to hold on, as she rejoins Astrid (riding Meatlug,
          along with Fishlegs). He gives them a sheepish shrug.

                         

                          ASTRID
           You really are full of surprises.

                         
          She leaps onto Stormfly, steadying them.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Let's go!

                         
          Together they rocket across the sky...

                          TUFFNUT
           Dragon Riders coming through!

                         
          And DIVE-BOMB the traps, setting them aflame. The yokes and
          leather bindings restraining the bait dragons are
          incinerated, freeing them to fly away, unharmed.

                         

                          DRAGO

           CUT THEM DOWN!

                         
          Projectiles are launched, one of which KNOCKS Ruffnut off her
          dragon. She PLUMMETS past Eret toward the rocky shore below.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Eret, son of Eret!

                         
          She suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks.

          RUFFNUT'S POV: of Snotlout on one side... and Fishlegs on the
          other. SOFT and ROMANTICIZED as her epiphany dawns.

                         
          Above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires
          of ice, directly over Astrid and Eret.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's
           it! Look out!

                         
          It's about to crush them when... it's BLOWN TO PIECES by
          Toothless' fireball. Hiccup, Stoick, and Gobber come bursting
          through the flames on their dragons.

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set
          their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers.

                         
          Toothless BLASTS one of Drago's net launchers, knocking it
          onto its side. Stoick then CHOPS the trigger line, FIRING the
          catapult and NETTING the throng of soldiers, freeing the
          dragon.

                         
          Drago's ARCHERS target Stoick with their arrows.

                         

                          ARCHER
           Take `em down!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Heads up!

                         
          Gobber flies up from behind, KNOCKING the archers out with
          Grump's tail. Gobber chuckles.

                         
          DRAGO hears Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream and turns to
          see him streaking across the sky.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Dragon Master.

                         
          Hiccup catches up to Astrid and Eret on Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Welcome aboard, dragon rider!

                         

                          ERET
           Thanks. I think.

                         
          Astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see Hiccup.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Where have you been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.

          Astrid shoots him a confused glare. He nods skyward. Astrid
          and Eret look up to see...

                         
          VALKA, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice
          spikes, atop Cloudjumper.

                         

                          ERET
           Whoa...

                         
          An earth-trembling roar follows as the Bewilderbeast rises
          behind Valka.

                         

                          ASTRID
           That's your mother?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Well, now you know where I get my
           dramatic flair.

                         
          ON DRAGO, gawking in awe as the great BEWILDERBEAST BLASTS
          an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.

                         

                          DRAGO
           The alpha! Now we have a fight!

                         
          Valka blasts overhead on Cloudjumper, commanding swarms of
          dragons to swoop down and attack Drago's army. A swarm of
          Zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon
          wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and
          destroying war machines.

                         
          One of them gets CAUGHT under a Dragon Swatter, but Hiccup
          and Toothless double-back for a rescue.

                         

                          HICCUP
           There! Come on, Toothless! Show
           them what you got, bud.
          Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a
          plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy!

                         
          BACK TO VALKA, on Cloudjumper as they pry Drago's armored
          dragons off of the flailing wild ones. A net suddenly
          envelops Cloudjumper. They CRASH heavily, but Valka cuts
          herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from Drago.

                         

                          DRAGO
           I've waited a long time for this!

                         
          Drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but Valka
          deflects Drago's hit and attacks him.

                          VALKA
           You cannot take our dragons! They
           are controlled by the alpha!

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (SMUG)
           Then it's a good thing I brought a
           challenger.

                         
          He turns to the flagship and YELLS savagely, whirling his
          bullhook overhead.

                         
          The heavy chains are released. The underwater creature, now
          freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. It
          rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be...

                         
          A SECOND BEWILDERBEAST -- bigger, meaner, and covered in
          scars that indicate years of training and abuse. The chains
          fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks.

                         
          Valka GASPS.

                         

                          HICCUP

           Another one?

                         

                          FISHLEGS

           I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!

           CLASS TEN!

                         
          Drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on Valka's
          Bewilderbeast.

                         

                          VALKA
           No. No.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Come on! Take down the alpha!

                         
          Valka attacks Drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his
          commands, but Drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully
          onto her back. He pins her as she struggles, removing her
          mask and staff. He's about to finish her off, when WHAM! He's
          knocked to the ground. He looks up, fuming, to see Stoick
          helping Valka to her feet.

                         

                          VALKA
           Thank you.

                         

                          STOICK
           For you, my dear... anything.

          As Drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak,
          circling Stoick, Drago's Bewilderbeast confronts Valka's in a
          threat display.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Val, do you think you can stop
           them?

                         

                          VALKA
           I'll do my best! Come on,
           Cloudjumper!

                         
          Valka cuts the nets away and hops onto Cloudjumper, flying
          off toward the Bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,

          CLASHING TUSKS.

                         
          Drago LUNGES at Stoick, SWIPING his bullhook.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You... I watched you burn!

                         
          The two imposing warriors CLASH WEAPONS, SLASHING and LANDING

          PUNCHES.

                         

                          STOICK
           It takes more than a little fire to
           kill me!

                         
          Valka flies between the Bewilderbeasts, waving her staff
          commandingly, but to no effect.

                         

          BACK TO STOICK AND DRAGO

                         
          As Drago hooks and yanks the axe out of Stoick's hands.
          Gobber flies by and HURLS his mace attachment.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Stoick!

                         
          Stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on Drago.

                         
          But, with a devastating SWIPE, DRAGO's Bewilderbeast takes
          down Valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its
          opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.

                         

                          VALKA
           No!

                         
          Hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere
          land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha -

          - DRAGO'S ALPHA.

                         

                          DRAGO
           We've won.

          Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           Now finish her!

                         
          Stoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the
          alpha's sights.

                         

                          STOICK
           No!

                         
          Drago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers
          Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing
          them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          He LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!

                         
          Stoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows
          brazenly, waving it aloft.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Right behind ya, Stoick!

                         

                         

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS


                         
          (Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice)

                         
          With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a
          throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages
          to cling to her dragon's neck.
          As she loses her grip and FALLS...

                         
          Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks
          his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing.
          Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out.

                         
          BACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding
          the Bewilderbeast to finish the job.

                         

                          HICCUP
           STOP! Stop!

                         
          Hiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly
          removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins
          to CHUCKLE.

           shame he must feel.

                         
          Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a
          hand gesture.

                         

                          HICCUP
           All of this loss, and for what? To
           become unstoppable? To rule the
           world?

                         
          Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dragons are kind, amazing creatures
           that can bring people together.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Or tear them apart.

                         
          Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing
          a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           You see, I know what it is to live
           in fear. To see my village burned,
           my family taken.

                         
          He reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But even as a boy, left with
           nothing, I vowed to rise above the
           fear of dragons and liberate the
           people of this world.

                          HICCUP
           Then why a dragon army?

                         

                          DRAGO
           (grinning, smug)
           Well, you need dragons to conquer
           other dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Or maybe you need dragons to
           conquer people.

                          (BEAT)
           To control those who follow you...
           and to get rid of those who won't.

                          DRAGO
           Clever boy.

                         
          Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless
          readies himself.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The world wants peace. And we have
           the answer, back on Berk. Just let
           me show you.

                         

                          DRAGO
           NO! Let ME show YOU.

                         
          Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless
          circles Hiccup, protectively.

                         
          ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It
          hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently.

                         

                          STOICK
           What...?

                         
          Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He
          spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)

                          (PANICKED)
           Hiccup!

                         
          He rushes off. Valka follows, racing past Gobber as he
          finally joins them, winded from having run up the mountain.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           Come on, Gobber!

                         

                          GOBBER
           Okay, change of plans.

                         
          He hurries back down the mountain after them.

                         

          BACK TO DRAGO

                         
          jabbing his bullhook into the ground commandingly. The
          Bewilderbeast flinches and stops, submissive.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No dragon can resist the alpha's
           command. So he who controls the
           alpha, controls them all.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78.

                         

                         
          Drago points to Toothless. The Bewilderbeast stares and
          HISSES, forcing Toothless to cower under a hypnotic
          ultrasonic broadcast. Toothless struggles against the alpha's
          command, writhing and grinding his head against the ground.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? You okay, bud? What's
           going on?

                         
          Toothless fights the command, shaking his head in protest.
          The Bewilderbeast insists, with a mesmerizing glare and a
          low, throaty grumble... until Toothless finally succumbs to
          its control. He raises his head, his stare vacant and
          robotic, as his pupils turn to slits.

                         
          Drago then points to Hiccup. The Bewilderbeast responds,
          HISSING again at Toothless.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Witness true strength. The strength
           of will over others. In the face of
           it, you are nothing.

                         
          Toothless slowly turns to face Hiccup. Advancing.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Uh, what did he just tell you?

                         

                         ON STOICK

                         
          Bounding across the ice, pushing himself to make it to Hiccup
          in time.

                         

          BACK ON HICCUP

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless, what's the matter with
           you? What're you doing?

                         
          Hiccup is backed against fallen ice, with Toothless advancing
          mindlessly, and nowhere to run.

                         
          Toothless opens his yawning mouth. Gas seeps from his throat.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!

                         
          Stoick barrels through ice formations and over war machines,
          racing against time.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't!

                          STOICK
           Hiccup!

                         

                          HICCUP

           STOP!

                         

                          STOICK

           SON!

                         
          Hiccup sees Stoick about to run into the fray.

                         

                          HICCUP

           DAD! NO!

                         
          Toothless BLASTS.

                         
          Stoick leaps in front of it, shoving Hiccup out of the way
          and absorbing the blast in the process. He's thrown against
          the ice with great impact.

                         
          ON VALKA, hearing the blast, horrified.

                         
          Drago glances back, seeing Stoick laying lifeless in the
          aftermath, pleased by the sudden turn of events. He shuffles
          off, satisfied.

                         
          Stunned, Hiccup comes to and sees Stoick in the rubble. He
          rushes past the still-entranced Toothless, straining to
          scatter the ice boulders on top of Stoick's body.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Dad!

                         
          Valka arrives, winded and aghast.

                         

                          VALKA
           Stoick...
          She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses
          her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere
          glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No... you...

                         
          Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed.

                         
          Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless
          of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and
          confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand.
          Hiccup SHOVES him.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No! Get away from him!

          Toothless recoils, innocently.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)

           GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!

                         
          Toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and
          head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls
          upon Stoick, inconsolable.

                         

                          VALKA
           It's not his fault. You know that.

                         
          On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the
          dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others
          all follow the command as the Gang calls after them.

                         

           VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Good dragons under the control of
           bad people do bad things.

                         
          Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again
          slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha
          without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle,
          pedals, and prosthetic tail.

                         
          ON HICCUP and VALKA

                         
          In tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the
          saddle.

                         

                          DRAGO

           GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!

                         
          His soldiers cheer in the thousands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back.

                         

                          VALKA
           No, don't!

                         
          Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The
          alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Move out!

                         
          Hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons TAKE WING and
          follow.

          EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK


                         
          (Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral)

                         
          A KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing,
          battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           May the Valkyries welcome you, and
           lead you through Odin's great
           battlefield. May they sing your
           name with love and fury, so that we
           might hear it rise from the heights
           of Valhalla... and know that you've
           taken your rightful place at the
           table of kings.

                         
          Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the
          battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes
          with sympathetic glance.

                         

           GOBBER (V.O.)
           For a great man has fallen. A
           warrior. A chieftain. A father. A
           friend.

                         
          Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage,
          igniting the pitch that coats the tip.

                         
          He releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands
          on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre,
          covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest.

                         
          The others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and
          LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing,
          flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship
          alight.
          ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm sorry, Dad.

                         
          He eyes the engulfed ship.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm not the chief that you wanted
           me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I
           thought I was. I don't know...

                         
          Valka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward.

                          VALKA
           You came early into this world. You
           were such a wee thing. So frail, so
           fragile. I feared you wouldn't make
           it.

                         
          Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin.

                         

                          VALKA (CONT'D)
           But your father... he never
           doubted. He always said you'd
           become the strongest of them all.

                          (BEAT)
           And he was right.

                          (BEAT)
           You have the heart of a chief and
           the soul of a dragon. Only you can
           bring our worlds together. That is
           who you are, son.

                         
          Hiccup meets her bolstering stare. He turns to the ship and
          watches it in silence, silhouetted in its glow.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I was so afraid of becoming my dad.
           Mostly because I thought I never
           could. How do you become someone
           that great? That brave? That
           selfless?

                          (BEAT)
           I guess you can only try.
           (to the others)
           A chief protects his own. We're
           going back.

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Uh, with what?

                          RUFFNUT
           He took all the dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Not all of them.

          WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! JUVENILES BLUR past, like flying
          raptors, ZIGZAGGING wildly.

                         
          Riding bareback, Hiccup & Co. HURTLE through the narrow ICE
          CHANNELS -- created by massive splits in the iceberg shelves.

           Fly straight!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I don't want to die!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           We can't fly these things!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Yeah, no kidding!

                         
          Fishlegs barrels into a snow bank, sending several chunks
          right into Eret's face as rides inverted and HOLLERING.

                         

                          ASTRID
           But won't that Bewilderbeast just
           take control of these guys, too?

                         

                          HICCUP
           They're babies. They don't listen
           to anyone!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Yeah, just like us!

                         
          Gobber follows up the rear clumsily, STRUGGLING for control.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This... is... very dangerous!

                         
          He PULLS ALONGSIDE Hiccup and Valka.

                         

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           Some might suggest this is poorly
           conceived.

                          HICCUP
           Well, it's a good thing that I
           never listen.

                         
          A SHARP RIDGE RUSHES up at them. They're going to CRASH.
          Hiccup ROUNDS one side of it, and Gobber flies down the other
          side. They shout through gaps in the iceberg.

                         

                          GOBBER
           So what IS your plan?!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-

                         
          He's interrupted by another closure in the gaps of ice. They
          blast out of the other side.

           Heads up!

                         
          They SPLIT to avoid another peak and then reconvene, only to
          find another icy outcropping directly in their path.

                         

                          HICCUP
           And that thing.

                         
          Gobber HITS it, with a THUD and a YELP.

          (Scene 2450 - Hiccup Vs. Toothless)

                         
          Torches burn in their braziers as Berk slumbers... until the
          Bewilderbeast approaches, STOMPING down on the monolithic
          Viking statues that guard the harbor.

                         

                         

          INT. GOTHI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The sound of destruction rouses a flock of Terrible Terrors
          and Gothi, who was sleeping under the dragons. Their pupils
          turn to slits, and heeding the ultrasonic call, they fly off.

                         
          Gothi shuffles onto her deck, confused, then GASPS at
          horrifying sight.

                         

                         

          INT. VIKING HUT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Gronckle lounges peacefully by the fire, as his Viking
          owner lavishes him with scratches.

                         

                          HOARK
           Ah, that's a good boy!

                         
          The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes
          wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the
          door.

                         

                          HOARK (CONT'D)
           Watch the furniture! Where are you
           going?

                         
          It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the
          Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting
          sight with a gasp.

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Vikings pour out of the Great Hall as all of Berk's dragons
          fill the night sky and join the ranks of Drago's growing

          DRAGON ARMY.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rises out of the sea, bearing down on the
          people of Berk as Drago hovers on Toothless, leading the
          charge. The Vikings stare, aghast.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Your chief is dead.

                         
          Waves of shock and whispers of "Stoick?" spread through the
          crowd.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           No one can protect you now.

                         
          He thrusts his bull-hook, commanding the Bewilderbeast to
          fire. The Vikings watch in horror as the Bewilderbeast opens
          its yawning jaws and BLASTS.

          Dragon roars grow louder as Hiccup & Co. approach through
          clouds, racing against time.

                         
          They collectively GASP at the sight of Drago's Bewilderbeast
          having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice.
          Berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind
          him, joining Valka's flock, and corralled by Drago's armored
          dragons.

                         

                          HICCUP
           No...

                          FISHLEGS
           He took all the dragons!

                          ERET
           Have you forgotten who you're
           riding with?

                         
          He brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the Bewilderbeast.

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           There isn't a dragon alive that I
           can't wrangle!

                         
          His baby dragon dives toward the sea instead.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Except for this one!

           Amateur.

                         
          The others shrug and follow. As they get closer, the
          Bewilderbeast looms bigger and BIGGER.

                         
          Berk's Vikings in hiding notice Hiccup and the others as they
          approach.

                         

                          VIKING #1
           Look, it's Hiccup!

                         
          The Vikings CHEER.

                         
          ON DRAGO, surprised to see Hiccup and the others approaching.

                         

                          DRAGO
           What?

                         
          With an irate HUFF, the Bewilderbeast focuses on Hiccup,
          gaining ever closer to Toothless.

                         
          Suddenly, a SHEEP appears in its sight, rising and falling
          out of view. The Bewilderbeast blinks, confused.

                         
          It looks down to see Eret catching the falling sheep and
          reloading it into the game launcher, as Tuffnut cocks the
          mechanism and Ruffnut pulls the trigger.

                          RUFFNUT
           Keep `em coming!

                         
          Snotlout tosses the black sheep to Tuffnut.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Black sheep, baby!

                         
          Exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when... HONK!
          The game horn blares, breaking his concentration.

                         
          He turns, finding the horn unmanned. The Bewilderbeast then
          returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the BLACK
          SHEEP LANDS on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines
          and becoming lodged.

           Ten points!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast shakes the black sheep off and prepares to
          blast again.

                         

                          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh...

                         
          HONK! The alpha whips around -- still no one at the horn.

                         
          ON FISHLEGS, giggling and hiding behind the game horn.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast finally lets loose the ice blast, covering
          the entire horn in jagged spikes... as Fishlegs leaps from
          the platform.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           I'm okay!

                         

          BACK TO HICCUP

                         
          as he reaches Drago, hovering directly in Toothless' sights.

                         

                          DRAGO
           You certainly are hard to get rid
           of. I'll say that.

                         
          Hiccup ignored him and focuses on Toothless' slitted pupils.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me.
           I'm right here. Come back to me.

                         
          TOOTHLESS' POV: Hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur,
          still firmly under the control of the Bewilderbeast.

                          DRAGO
           He is not yours anymore. He belongs
           to the alpha!

                         
          Drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in
          invitation.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           But, please, oh great dragon
           master, try to take him. He will
           not miss a second time.

                         
          Hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with Toothless.
          He reaches out to touch him.

                          HICCUP
           It wasn't your fault, bud. They
           made you do it.

                         
          Drago's amusement fades as Toothless stirs. His pupils
          DILATE, then NARROW again.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You'd never hurt him.

                          (BEAT)
           You'd never hurt me.

                         
          Drago watches, amazed, as Toothless fights the control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           How are you doing that?

                         
          Hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Please. You are my best friend,
           bud.

                         
          Bewilderbeast ROARS a forceful command.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           My best friend.

                         
          Toothless' pupils jitter, then DILATE fully. He coos
          sympathetically.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!

                         
          Toothless' eyes finally dilate fully and resolve on Hiccup's
          familiar face.
          Drago goes from astounded to alarmed. Drago STRIKES Toothless
          with the bull hook in a vain attempt to regain control.

                         

                          DRAGO
           No!

                         
          Toothless ROARS defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his
          jaws, and PULLS... yanking Drago off of his back and sending
          him both PLUMMETING to the sea.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!

                         
          But without a rider, Toothless drops out of the sky as well.
          Hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.

           Hang on!

                         
          Drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the
          Bewilderbeast's tusk...

                         
          As Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between
          he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Almost there, buddy. Almost there!

                         
          Hiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and
          skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's
          head.

          (Scene 2500 - One True Alpha)

                         
          Hiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top
          of the Bewilderbeast's head.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Do something!

                         

                          HICCUP
           We need to get those two apart.

                         
          Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the
          flag.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing
          them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta block him out, Toothless.
           Do you trust me, bud?

                         
          Toothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the
          flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We can do this. You and me. As one.

                         
          Hiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds,
          MATCHING the move with the natural half.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That's it. Now let's try this one
           more time!

          They PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading
          back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the
          cheering Vikings on the ground.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Take them down, babe!

                         
          The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past.

                         
          Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and
          the alpha.

                         

                          VALKA
           Go get `em.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Take control of it!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no
          avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates,
          muffling the alpha's commands.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Shut it out, Toothless!

                         

                          DRAGO

           STOP THEM!

                         
          The Bewilderbeast BLASTS!

                         

                          HICCUP

           NOW!

                         
          Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago
          LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock.

                         
          DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky,
          the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE.

                         
          Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see...

                         
          HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his
          Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses
          him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting
          Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM.

                         
          Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive
          dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook
          landing just out of reach.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup.

           Not again.

           TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER!

                         
          Toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and
          rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Come on, bud!

                         
          Together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing
          tail...

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Hold on!

                         
          And shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it!

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah! We did it!

                         
          They arc through the sky and LAND a few paces from Drago,
          kicking up a trail of dust.

                         
          Battered and weary, Drago reaches for his bullhook. Hiccup
          extends and fires up his Dragon Blade, hurling it like a
          javelin, and sticking it in the ground between Drago and his
          weapon, singeing his outstretched hand.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Agghh!

                         

                          HICCUP
           Hold him there Toothless!

                         
          Toothless SNARLS a warning, ready to blast.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           It's all over now.

                         
          But the cloud of dust settles, revealing the Bewilderbeast,
          rising behind Hiccup, ready to blast him instead.

                         

                          DRAGO

                          (GRINNING KNOWINGLY)
           Or is it?

                         
          Hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a RUSH of water THUNDERS up
          the Bewilderbeast's throat.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, no!

          It BLASTS, but Toothless leaps into the way, shielding Hiccup
          beneath him. The freezing explosion envelops them both.

                         
          Drago laughs to himself as Valka lands her baby dragon and
          rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it
          desperately.

                         

                          VALKA
           No! No...

                         
          ON ASTRID and GOBBER, watching from a distance, horrified. As
          Valka POUNDS at the ice, a GLOWS forms from deep within. She
          realizes what is about to happen and backs away.

                         
          A BLAST thunders from inside the ice, SHATTERING it.
          Toothless emerges from the debris, revealing Hiccup curled
          safely under his wings.

                         
          Toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage,
          his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow
          emanating from his flared nostrils.

                         
          He turns back to Hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then
          turns his full attention back to the Bewilderbeast. He leaps
          out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring
          ferociously.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. Toothless
          unleashes a salvo of plasma into the Bewilderbeast's face,
          not letting up.

                         

                          HICCUP
           He's challenging the alpha!

                         

                          VALKA
           To protect you.
          The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination.
          Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control.

                         
          The alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash
          Toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire,
          continuing his unrelenting attack.

                         
          In the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons
          -- both Berk's and Valka's -- break free from the control to
          witness Toothless' retaliation.

                         
          Toothless lands protectively by Hiccup and Valka, commanding
          the dragons to shift sides. The follow, amassing behind
          Toothless.

                         
          Seeing this, Drago panics and rushes toward the
          Bewilderbeast.

           No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!

           FIGHT!

                         
          Drago clambers up the Bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.

                         

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)
           (to the defecting dragons)
           What's the matter with you?

                         
          The Berkians swell in to show their unified support. Drago
          fumes as Hiccup and Toothless fly up together onto an ice
          spire.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Now do you get it? This is what it
           is to earn a dragon's loyalty.

                          (BEAT)
           Let this end now.

                         

                          DRAGO
           Never! Come on!

                         
          He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge.

                         
          Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to
          ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid-
          charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another,
          and another.

                         
          Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons
          opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started
          a rebellion.

                         
          Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking
          cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.

                          DRAGO (CONT'D)

           FIGHT! BLAST THEM!

                         
          His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own
          armored dragons.

                         
          The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but
          Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's
          head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball.

                         
          As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the
          ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless.

                         
          Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           The alpha protects them all.

          Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the
          new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the
          sea in an explosive splash.

                         
          The Berkians CHEER in victory!

                         
          As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but
          bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of
          the Bewilderbeast... or Drago.

                         
          Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people
          celebrate all around them.

                         
          All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land
          around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a
          wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha.

                         
          Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic
          ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute.

                         
          Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You never cease to amaze me, bud.
           Thank you.

                         
          Toothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals,
          trying to get away.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! You know that doesn't
           wash out.

                         
          The crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite
          with their Vikings.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!

                         
          Stormfly bounds into Astrid.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!

                         
          Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him.

                         
          Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race
          towards the expectant Ruffnut...

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Who's my little princess?

                         
          ... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           I missed you so much!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Don't you ever leave again,
           Hookfang!

                         
          Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console
          her.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Oh Barf!

                         
          She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut
          pushes him away...

                         

                          RUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Not you.

                         
          And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her.

                         
          Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher
          approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets
          him, as Eret approaches.

                         

                          ERET
           That was some pretty fine dragon
           wrangling back there. You'd make a
           good trapper.

                         
          Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret
          affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need
           somebody to look after him now.

                          ERET
           Me?

                         
          Hiccup nods reassuringly. Eret looks at Skullcrusher, pausing
          to consider it.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           I'd be honored.

                         
          Valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.

                         

                          VALKA
           Your father... he'd be every bit as
           proud as I am.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP
           Thank you. I'm really glad you're
           here, Mom.

                         

                          VALKA
           And here I'll stay.

                         
          Toothless arrives, purring at Valka's touch as Astrid strides
          toward Hiccup, beaming proudly.

                         

                          ASTRID
           See? I told you it was in here.

                         
          She places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the
          dorsal fin button, popping it open. She GIGGLES.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Ha, ha. Still doing that one?
           That's hilarious.

                          (THEN)
           Come here, you.

                         
          He scoops Astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. Gobber
          covers a gawking boy's eyes.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Ooh.

                         
          Gothi, the elder, taps Hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the
          romantic moment. She gestures for Hiccup to kneel. He does
          so, respectfully.

                         
          Using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, Gothi traces a
          Viking symbol onto Hiccup's forehead. She bows.

                         
          Hiccup stands, meeting Gobber's proud, smiling eyes. Gobber
          turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.

                          GOBBER (CONT'D)
           The chief has come home!

                         
          The Berkians erupt with cheers and applause as Hiccup takes
          in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now
          upon him.

                         
          Toothless throws back his head and BLASTS in celebration,
          spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the
          sky in a spectacular display.

                         

                         

          EXT. BERK VILLAGE - DAY

           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 97.

                         

                         
          A sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a Terrible Terror
          struggles in vain to carry him off. Suddenly, both are
          snatched up by a passing dragon.

                         

                         

          IN THE AIR

                         
          Ruffnut and Tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop Barf & Belch.
          Ruffnut send the sheep flying toward Fishlegs. Snotlout nabs
          it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. A bit trampled and
           busted and covered in ice, but it's
           home. It's our home.

                         
          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as
          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race
          atop Skullcrusher.

                         
          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting
          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers
          are rebuilding the damaged houses.

                         
          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of
          Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Those who attacked us are
           relentless and crazy. But those who
           stopped them? Oh, even more so!

                         
          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to
          ensure that no trouble is approaching.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to
          join the game. He smiles.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We may be small in numbers, but we
           stand for something bigger than
           anything the world can pit against
           us.

                         
          Astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to Valka and
          Gobber as they remove the armor from Drago's freed battle
          dragons.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We are the voice of peace. And bit
           by bit, we will change this world.

          Realizing that he's late, Gobber hurries over to the sheep
          launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep
          hurtling into the air.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to
          snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless
          dart past, beating them to it. Toothless looks back with a
          gummy smile.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           You see, we have something they
           don't. Oh sure, they have armies
           and they have armadas...

                         
          Toothless and Hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. As they
          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him
          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on
          the other side. The crowd cheers!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           But we... we have...

                         
          Hiccup and Toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by
          Astrid, Stormfly, and the other dragon riders.

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)

           OUR DRAGONS!

                         
          Toothless lets out a proud roar as Hiccup look out over Berk,
          gleaming with pride.


httyd3
(Scene opens at night, on a Dragon Trapper ship. Many dragons are locked in cages, while Ivar, a Dragon Trapper, patrols the area. One dragon roars in frustration, and Ivar taps on the cage.)

Ivar the Witless: Quiet!

(Hiccup comes out of the fog wearing his dragon armor and lights up his Inferno.)

Ivar: What are you?

Hiccup: Shh!

(Toothless climbs down a cage behind Ivar, with the spines on his back glowing blue. The Trapper then attacks Hiccup, who accidentally knocks a lamp, causing the floor to burst into flames. Hiccup and Toothless come out of the fire unharmed, thanks to the fireproof dragon scales.)

Ivar: AAH! YOU'RE A DEMON!

Hiccup: Shhh! Shh, shh, shh! No, no! I'm not a demon! I'm not a demon!

(Hiccup takes off his mask.)

Hiccup: See? Just a guy! Just a guy, here to rescue these dragons, so...

Ivar: But you walked through fire!

Hiccup: Dragon Scales! Dragons shed a lot.

Ivar: Ooh! I know a demon when I see one! No human legs are that skinny!

(Snotlout lands on a light up Hookfang behind the Trapper.)

Snotlout: Think that’s a good entrance? Get a load of me! Aah!

(Snotlout's butt catches on fire and the boy runs away.)

Ivar: AAH! I KNEW IT! MORE DEMONS?!

Hiccup: That's really just a nitwit who forgot to fireproof his butt.

Snotlout: Hot! Hot, hot, hot! Guys! No! Not yet!

(Barf and Belch create a little explosion, which knocks down Snotlout, as the twins get off their dragon.)

Tuffnut: Behold, your worst nightmare...

Ruffnut: Behold--

Tuffnut: ...along with his sister who insisted on coming.

Ruffnut: That's my intro?

Hiccup: Guys! Too soon. You always come in too soon!

(Fishlegs lands on his back in front of Hiccup, slipping on the floor.)

Fishlegs: Sorry, still getting the hang of my wings.

Hiccup: Fishlegs, again with the baby? This is a raid.

Fishlegs: I couldn't find a sitter.

(Ivar gets scared of the Dragon Riders in armor and runs away.)

Ivar: DEMONS EVERYWHERE! IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD!

(Astrid jumps from a cage and pushes the Trapper against it, knocking him unconscious.)

Hiccup: Astrid! I had him right where I wanted him.

Astrid: And now he's right where I wanted him. Let's get to work.

Hiccup: Okay, we screwed that up. But, at least nobody else knows we're here.

(However, on the opposite side of the ship, several trappers are running towards the dragon riders.)

(Hiccup then goes to unlock a cage and free a Scuttleclaw.)

Hiccup: Easy, girl. It's okay. Shh! We're gonna get you out of here.

(On another part of the ship, Fishlegs opens a big cage.)

Fishlegs: Ooh! A Crimson Goregutter! Ooooh, hoo, hoo!

(Fishmeat gets excited too, and the Crimson Goregutter looks at the baby, bewildered. Meanwhile, Ruffnut looks at a Hobgobbler in a cage.)

Ruffnut: Ha. Ha. Look at this weirdo. I bet it's super dumb.

(Ruffnut tries to open the cage.)

Ruffnut: Why can't I get this cage open?

Astrid: It slides.

(Astrid opens the cage.)

Ruffnut: Obviously.

(The other Dragon Trapper discovers the Dragon Riders freeing their dragons.)

Dragon Trapper: Attack!

Hiccup: Get the rescued out of here!

Dragon Trapper: Get the Night Fury!

(The Dragon Riders and Trappers begin to fight. One Trapper falls in front of Tuffnut.)

Tuffnut: No running on the deck! It's slippery, You can fall.

Snotlout: Step aside! Let me handle the tough guy stuff!

(Snotlout is about to lose the fight, but Hookfang spits fire at the Trapper, saving his rider.)

Snotlout: Yee-ha! That's two for me!

(Fishlegs fights the Trappers with the help of the rescued Goregutter.)

Fishlegs: Look out!

(Astrid and Hiccup fight together, until they are aided by Toothless.)

Hiccup: Thank you. Now, go get the rest, bud!

Astrid: I thought this was supposed to be a stealth mission.

Hiccup: Yeah, they always start that way.

Astrid: Look out!

(A Trapper prepares to strike Astrid, but Stormfly grabs him and throws him into the ocean.)

Astrid: Thanks, Stormfly!

(Meanwhile, Valka and Cloudjumper watch the scene from above. The Stormcutter shows concern about the mission.)

Valka: Oh, stop worrying. They'll get it.

(The fighting continues and gets worse.)

Snotlout: RAWW!

(Snotlout runs and jumps off of a cage throwing his hammer at the same time but the cape of his dragon armor gets caught on the cage, leaving him hanging.)

Valka: Eventually.

Hiccup: Move out! We got them all!

Tuffnut: I'm gonna headlock every last one of you. I might even leglock you!

Snotlout: Amateurs! I was just getting started.

Astrid: Clear out, guys! Go! Go!

(All the riders except Hiccup gets on their dragons and fly away from the ship. Meanwhile, Toothless is inspecting an empty cage.)

Hiccup: Toothless! Time to go!

(Toothless runs towards his rider, while in the cage, a camouflaged dragon opens its eyes. Hiccup is surrounded by many Trappers.)

Hiccup: Oh! Hey, guys!

(Toothless comes in a hurry, knocks the Trappers, grabs his rider and flies away.)

Hiccup: Ha! Ha! You always have my back, bud!

(The Riders return with the rescued dragons to Berk, which is now a large dragon-Viking utopia.)

Hiccup: This is Berk. Your new home away from home. A stunning, one-styled, all-expense-paid dream destination. So settle in and let your worries melt away! The service here soars, the cuisine's fiery, and the locals are as colorful as you get.

(Hiccup gives a tour of Berk to the new rescued Crimson Goregutter.)

Hiccup: Any run of the mill paradise boasts beaches and sunshine...

(Vikings are seen hopping on dragons to get across to their homes.)

Hiccup: ...Well, not us. We've got something no one else can touch. We, my friend, have dragons. Lots - and lots - of dragons!

(The rescued Crimson Goregutter sits on a pole sticking out of a statue. The pole is turning around the statue. Then, Vikings and dragons quickly run out of the way of the Crimson Goregutter, which finally lands on the Isle of Berk.)

Hiccup: Gang, meet our latest Berkians.

(The Crimson Goregutter roars and two Berkians meet the new rescued dragons.)

Viking man: Welcome to paradise, mate!

Viking woman: Oh, aren't you a beauty?

(Snotlout comes, pushing everyone out of his way.)

Snotlout: Ah, you're welcome, you're welcome. I took on, like, a hundred trappers- a, a thousand trappers!

Ruffnut: All with burning undies.

Tuffnut: My thick, full beard almost caught on fire.

Ruffnut: Ugh. Just, just stop.

Snotlout: So, uh, Hiccup's mom, any notes on my bone-crushing assault, or was it pretty much perfect?

Valka: Oh, it was... indescribable. And please, call me Valka. It has been a year.

(Snotlout nods to himself and smiles.) 

Snotlout: First name basis.

Hiccup: I think the real hero today was Toothless, isn't that right, bud? What would we do without you, oh, King of Dragons? What would we do?

Astrid: Well, we could train a lot harder, for one. That was pretty sloppy.

Valka: Astrid, uh, does have a point. Perhaps you all rely a little bit too much on your dragons and not enough on one another.

Snotlout: See? That's exactly what I was saying. Just, listen up, guys! Yeah, your mom's super impressed with me. I'm like the son she always wanted.

(Fishmeat jumps out of Fishlegs' pocket and goes to play with the Crimson Goregutter.)

Fishlegs: Fishmeat! You found a new friend!

(The Crimson Goregutter starts jumping around, knocking things)

Viking man: Mind your heads!

(Eventually, the Goregutter hits a building, which knocks out others in a row, all collapsing into the ocean.)

Gobber: Ugh! What good is having the King of Dragons around if he can't keep the order?

Hiccup: Hey, bud, do you wanna do something here, or...?

(Toothless roars at the Goregutter, which in turn bows respectfully to his Alpha.)

Gobber: And where do you suppose we put these ones?

Hiccup: Eh, we'll make room.

Gobber: Aah! You brought back a Hobgobbler. They're a bad omen. We're cursed.

(Hiccup laughs.)

Valka: Nonsense. What harm could he do?

(Valka picks up the Hobgobbler and examines him)

Valka: No injuries. They're all a little shaken, but otherwise healthy. Now, who's hungry?

(Scene cuts later in the day, inside the Great Hall, where lots of dragons and Vikings are eating. The dragons are flying all over the place.)

Gobber: Point is, you can't keep bringing dragons back here.

(Gothi, while sitting on her staff being flown by her flock of Terrible Terrors, flies by and lightly shocks Gobber.)

Gobber: Aah!

Snotlout: Come on, boy!

Gobber: You're just asking for trouble.

(Hiccup stops walking and makes Gobber stop as a Berkian chases a Scuttleclaw carrying a fish of his possession, passing Hiccup, and Gobber. They continue walking after they have passed.)

Viking man: No, you don't, you little thief!

Gobber: Those Trappers are getting closer by the day.

(Gobber lifts a Zippleback's tail up so they can walk under it.)

Hiccup: We can handle them. We have the Alpha. Ain't that right, bud? Would you look at how happy they are?

(Valka and Spitelout are having an arm wrestle. Valka wins the arm wrestle, making Spitelout angry and Valka laugh.)

Snotlout: She's awesome.

Hiccup: Gobber, relax. We did it. The world's first dragon-Viking utopia. We made the dream a reality.

Gobber: Your dream, maybe. Mine's less crowded and more...

(The Hobgobbler is floating inside of a cauldron.)

Gobber: Aah! Sanitary.

Hiccup: Gobber, you're not fooling anybody. I know you love them.

(The Hobgobbler is still floating in the cauldron but Toothless scares it, which makes it swim out of the cauldron.)

Gobber: You're supposed to be the generation that leads us into the future.

(Tuffnut is trying to get his plate back from Barf's mouth. But after he takes it back, Tuffnut accidentally makes the food fly over to Snotlout, making Snotlout think Tuffnut wants a food fight.)

Snotlout: Ha-ha! Food fight!

(Snotlout throws the food back at Tuffnut, causing the two of them to have a food fight. Then Ruffnut, who is sitting on the table with a mug of mead, joins in after Tuffnut throws food at her.)

Ruffnut: Mmm, gorg-e-ousss. Watch the hair!

(Fishlegs is holding a little spoon with food in it and moving it closer to Fishmeat.)

Fishlegs: Good Fishmeat.

(Fishmeat then eats the food with the spoon in his mouth. Food hits Gobber in the face.)

Gobber: Ugh! Thor help us. Time to stop worrying about problems out there...

Astrid: Gobber...

Gobber: ...and start sorting out the ones right here.

(Gobber has Hiccup in a headlock on his right and Astrid held in his left arm. Hiccup is having trouble breathing and talking.)

Hiccup: Okay, okay. I-I'll think about it.

Gobber: Hang up those saddles and get married.

(The food fight suddenly stops and everyone looks at Gobber.)

Tuffnut: The "m" word.

Ruffnut: Gross. Unless it's me.

(Ruffnut throws food again.)

Gobber: Start ruling like a proper royal couple. (To Astrid.) Marry him, please. You're the only one with any sense around here. With you wearing the pants, there's still hope.

(Hiccup has been put into a headlock again by Gobber.)

Astrid: Wow! Gobber... Not awkward at all.

(Astrid leaves the table and Gobber follows behind. Hiccup finally gets out of the headlock.)

Gobber: Astrid, don't be like that. (Gobber goes after her.)

Tuffnut: Whoa. That is a definitive no. Look, if you need a beard to cry on--

(Tuffnut pulls Hiccup towards him so Hiccup's face is now in Tuffnut's beard.)

Tuffnut: --just lean on my shoulder and you can cry into my full, thick beard.

Hiccup: Oh, thank you, Tuffnut. Thank you. So much.

(Eret walks towards Hiccup and Tuffnut. Firstly, shocked at what he's seeing but then gets Hiccup's attention by clearing his throat.)

Hiccup: Eret, son of Eret!

(Hiccup forces himself off of Tuffnut's beard so he can speak to Eret.)

Hiccup: What's the report?

Eret, Son of Eret: Two more trapper barges spotted in the strait.

Hiccup: So we go after them.

(Hiccup turns around and looks at Gobber who doesn't look surprised with Hiccup's response.)

Hiccup: What?

Gobber: One day, you're gonna pick a fight you can't win.

(Scene cuts to a bay full of ships and an armored island. Grimmel's airship is flying towards island and lands on it.)

Dragon Trapper: Archers!

(He steps off of his airship and walks to the dragon fighting arena where dragons are controlled using cages and chains. Grimmel and his Deathgrippers walk in amongst the cages and to the Warlords.)

Dragon Trapper: Deathgrippers.

Ivar: The Dragon Riders attacked us here...

(Ivar places a wooden boat on a map.)

Ivar: ...Off the eastern strait.

(Ragnar the Rock starts playing with another wooden boat and makes it "crash" into Ivar's boat.)

Ragnar the Rock: Nnneeaoowww, BOOM.

Chaghatai Khan: Ragnar!

Ragnar: Um, sorry.

Grimmel the Grisly: My dear warlords. How go your plans to go conquer the world?

(Grimmel pulls his hood down.)

Ragnar: Ha-ha-ha! Grimmel, my old friend. Thank you for coming.

(One of Grimmel's Deathgrippers attacks and pins Ragnar down because he is getting too close to Grimmel.)

Ragnar: Oh-ah!

Grimmel: A year since Drago's defeat, and no further along with your dragon army, I see.

Griselda the Grevious: You can thank the young chief of Berk for that.

Grimmel: Stoick's boy?

(Ragnar is still pinned down by the Deathgripper and speaks while the Deathgripper is dribbling on him.)

Ragnar: Yup! He and his peace-loving Dragon Riders continue to raid our ships and steal our dragons.

Grimmel: Mmm. That does sound like a nuisance. But I'm in the business of killing dragons, not retrieving them.

(Grimmel walks away from the Warlords. However, Ragnar jumps up and tries to reason with Grimmel.)

Ragnar: Huh? But, Grimmel...

Grimmel: That idiot boy has done all of the work for you, gathering the dragons in one place. Why bother me?

Chaghatai: Because the flock is protected by a Night Fury.

(Grimmel stops in shock.)

Grimmel: Not possible.

Chaghatai: Hah, well, it seems one slipped through your fingers.

Ragnar: Look, Berk's dragons will follow their Alpha, so we'll pay you to capture him and bring the flock to us. We even have your favorite bait.

(The shot shows a Light Fury locked in a cage.)

Chaghatai: The only dragon they left us from last night's raid.

Grimmel: A female? Hmm.

(The Light Fury looks very frightened with a muzzle on its face.)

Ragnar: So, do we have a deal, old friend?

(A Rumblehorn gets agitated and breaks free from its chains. It charges towards the Warlords who run out of the way.)

Chaghatai: Watch out!

(Grimmel swings around and shoots a projectile from his bow which hits the Rumblehorn. The Rumblehorn collapses and skids on the dirt towards Grimmel.)

Grimmel: When all is said and done, this young chief will bring me the Night Fury.

(Grimmel walks away, after taking his foot out from under the Rumblehorn's head.)

Grimmel: They don't have a leader, just a boy.

(The scene changes to a flashback of Hiccup held by his dad, Stoick, talking on top of a cliff.)

Stoick: Hiccup. This is Berk, son. It's our home. It was the home of your grandparents, and their grandparents before them. And it's my job as chief to protect us, Hiccup. And one day, when you're all grown up, that job will be passed on to you.

Hiccup: Okay.

Stoick: And it's very important, son, because out there, beyond the sunset, lies the home of the dragons.

Hiccup: Wow!

Stoick: Aye! Legends tell of ships that sailed too close to it, only to drop off the edge of the world. Never to be seen again.

(Hiccup gasps.)

Stoick: But those sailors who turned back, told tales of a great waterfall and dragons guarding the entrance to a hidden world.

Hiccup: Whoa.

Stoick: Not just a nest, Hiccup, but a land from which all dragons come.

Hiccup: Even...Night Furies?

Stoick: (Laugh) Especially Night Furies.

Hiccup: Those are scary.

Stoick: Don't you worry. One day, I'll find the Hidden World and seal it up...so that people and dragons will fight no more.

(The scene changes from the flashback's Berk to the current Berk. Hiccup is on the same cliff as the flashback and Toothless pushes Hiccup lightly to get his attention.)

Hiccup: What?

(Toothless looks at Hiccup then looks at his leg and then back at Hiccup again.)

Hiccup: Oh, all right. You do know it's not a chew toy, don't you? Is this what you want? Oh, do you want this leg? Do you want my leg? Go get it.

(Hiccup throws his metal prosthetic leg and Toothless fetches it. Hiccup sits down and works on his map. Then, Hiccup's leg drops from the sky onto his map. Toothless then solo glides above Hiccup.)

Hiccup: Getting pretty good at gliding on your own, bud.

(Toothless lands next to Hiccup and tries to persuade Hiccup to throw his leg again by shoving his leg onto Hiccup's map. Hiccup moves his finger along to the left of the map and taps the empty spot. Astrid and Stormfly appear.)

Astrid: Oh! So this is where you come to get away from Gobber.

(They land next to Hiccup.)

Hiccup: I have no idea what you're talking about.

(Toothless gives Hiccup's sloppy prosthetic leg to Astrid.)

Astrid: Ugh!

(Astrid throws the leg away in disgust. Toothless and Stormfly fetch the leg together. Astrid walks to Hiccup and wipes her hands on Hiccup.)

Astrid: Well, he's right, you know.

Hiccup: R-Really? You think you and I should...

Astrid: Oh, gods, no. We're nowhere near ready for that!

Hiccup: No, that's... that's crazy.

Astrid: I mean he's right about all of this.

(Hiccup sighs and Astrid sits down next to him.)

Hiccup: It does seem like the whole world knows about us now.

Astrid: Yep. And the more dragons we bring back here, the bigger of a target we become.

(Hiccup's prosthetic leg falls on Astrid's lap.)

Astrid: Ugh.

(Astrid throws it away again.)

Astrid: I just wish there was some way to make them leave us alone.

Hiccup: There might be. Dad used to talk about an old mariners' myth. Of a secret land at the edge of the world, where dragons lived totally out of reach.

Astrid: Well, sailors are known for tall tales.

Hiccup: True. But what if it's real? It could be the answer to all of our problems.

Astrid: How? By moving the dragons there?

Hiccup: Uh-uh. All of us.

Astrid: Seriously? And abandon our home of seven generations? The home your father left you to protect.

Hiccup: Uh...

Astrid: Yeah, I think we need a real solution, Hiccup.

(Meanwhile, Toothless is chewing Hiccup's prosthetic leg and not letting Stormfly have a go.)

Hiccup: Well, we could just take Gobber's advice and tie the knot. That should fix everything. But, hey, if you're having doubts about yours truly, I'm pretty sure Snotlout's available.

Astrid: He only has eyes for your mom.

(Hiccup gasps.)

Hiccup: Oh! Playing dirty now, huh?

Astrid: You asked for it. Looks like there might be a wedding after all.

Hiccup: Oh, how dare you! (grabs Astrid and tickles her) That is a low blow. No, no, you are not getting away.

(Astrid then twists Hiccup's arm painfully, who in turn winces in pain.)

Hiccup: Owww! Okay, okay! You win, you win! You always win!

Astrid: You knew what you were getting into.

Hiccup: Uh-huh. Right.

(Toothless runs to the edge of the cliff and then glides down to the forest.)

Hiccup: Uh, bud? Wha-? Yeah, sure, don't bother to wait for us.

(Hiccup sighs.)

(In the forest, Toothless is wandering around searching for something. He uses his smell to sense where it is. He walks further and further into the forest until he spots a female Light Fury laying down in a part of the forest. The dragon turns around and spots Toothless, growling at him. Toothless gets scared but then walks closer to the dragon. They stare at each other until a snap is heard and the dragon shoots a plasma blast at a tree. Hiccup and Astrid arrive at the forest.)

Hiccup: Oh, my gods!

(The dragon growls at Hiccup and Astrid.)

Astrid: Uh, Hiccup!

(The dragon shoots a plasma blast at them, but Astrid manages to push Hiccup out of the way of the blast and they get thrown far but still survive the blast. The dragon is about to shoot another plasma blast but Toothless stops her.)

Hiccup: Yeah. You know, we're friends! No need to kill us.

(However, the Light Fury gets scared and flies away from them. Toothless tries to follow her by climbing the trees. But then the dragon fires a plasma blast and flies through it, turning invisible, also making Toothless sad.)

Hiccup: Wow!

Astrid: Another Night Fury.

Hiccup: No, not quite. It's more like a...Bright...Fury.

Astrid: A Light Fury!

Hiccup: Yeah, yours is better, probably.

(Scene changes back at Berk with all the dragon riders.)

Snotlout: What do you mean, gone?

Hiccup: Vanished! Into thin air.

Fishlegs: What do you think?

(Fishlegs shows Hiccup a drawing of what he thinks the Light Fury looks like.)

Hiccup: Uh-uh. Stubbier ears, no dorsal plates.

(Hiccup hands the drawing back to Fishlegs.)

Fishlegs: Okay, got it.

Eret: Haha. What a night.

(Toothless appears and pushes Hiccup. Lots of saliva is sticking out of his mouth.)

Hiccup: What-what's gotten into you? What is all this...slobbering and panting?

Astrid: Isn't it obvious? He's in love!

Hiccup: Trust me, relationships are nothing but pain and misery.

(He directed it to Toothless, but Astrid hears it and punches Hiccup.)

Astrid: Ugh.

Hiccup: What did I just say? Am-am I not enough?

(Toothless walks away and spots two Deadly Nadders who are performing a mating dance. He gets excited and runs closer.)

Tuffnut: I think that's a no.

(Toothless watches the Deadly Nadders.)

(Fishlegs shows Hiccup another sketch of the Light Fury.)

Fishlegs: Something like this?

Hiccup: You know what? Just trace your Toothless card and make her white.

(Hiccup hands the drawing back to Fishlegs.)

Fishlegs: You could have led with that...

Astrid: Can you believe it? Toothless has a girlfriend!

Hiccup: I never took you for a romantic. Like, ever!

Astrid: But it's so sweet. I mean, look!

(Toothless flirts with his own shadow on a wall in the same way the two Deadly Nadders were. He strokes his face on the wall and pushes his head towards it.)

Tuffnut: Oh, okay. That's just sad...and weird.

Ruffnut: Yeah, you better do something.

Snotlout: Seriously? I'd rather shovel poop all day than watch that.

Hiccup: Alright. Let's head back to the woods and see if we can find her.

(As Toothless hears that, he quickly looks at Hiccup and shows his excitement by running around.)

Tuffnut: Ah. Good idea!

(Tuffnut walks with Hiccup with his arm over Hiccup's shoulder.)

Tuffnut: A little privacy.

Hiccup: Uhhh...

Tuffnut: Shh. It's boy talk!

Hiccup: What?

(They walk off to the forest together with Toothless. Astrid shrugs her shoulders.)

Tuffnut: Come on. Let's go work this out.

(Scene cuts to Hiccup, Tuffnut and Toothless in the forest.)

Tuffnut: So. Wanna get married?

Hiccup: Uhh... No, actually.

Tuffnut: Good news. I've been to two weddings. I crashed both. But none as high profile as this one. Lots of pressure. Judgment. Not just by me.

Hiccup: Look. We talked about it. We're not getting married.

(Tuffnut stops walking and makes Hiccup stop too.)

Tuffnut: Cold feet! I've seen it before. Don't worry, little Hiccy. I'm here.

(Tuffnut walks off.)

Hiccup: Wait, Hiccy?

(Hiccup nods his head sideways and walks with Tuffnut again.)

Tuffnut: Now, I've seen the way Astrid looks at you. Everyone has that doubt. That not-so-subtle disappointment. That longing for something more than you. You need to focus on being worthy. I mean, she's a warrior queen for Thor's sake! And you are...neither. But with me as your best man, your spirit guide if you will, you'll learn to embrace your inner Viking. Show these naysayers, of which there are many, that you are more than just a malnourished runt with bad hair, strange teeth and a twig for a neck.

Hiccup: You're-you're really bad at pep talks.

Tuffnut: Stop letting these insecurities get the best of you.

(They stop walking as they arrive at the same place as where Toothless found the Light Fury. Toothless is seen to be walking around something.)

Tuffnut: Everyone's watching. I mean everyone. You need to man up. Do as I do. It will be hard, but...you have my word.

(Hiccup sees something metallic on the ground.)

Tuffnut: And until I break that word, I won't give up!

(Hiccup runs towards the metallic thing.)

Tuffnut: Hey! Hey! What, am I wasting my time here?

(Hiccup then picks the metallic thing up. It looks like a projectile dart.)

Tuffnut: You see some shiny thing in the woods- Oh, what is that?

(Toothless is still searching for the Light Fury. However, he finds nothing and becomes sad. He starts walking back towards Hiccup.)

Hiccup: Toothless!

(Toothless jumps back, frightened.)

Hiccup: Don't move a muscle.

(Hiccup takes Tuffnut's stick which Tuffnut has been carrying for the whole walk.)

Tuffnut: Hey!

(Hiccup throws the stick at a spot in the clearing, causing a dangerous trap to be triggered and Hiccup to fall backwards onto the ground. Toothless gets angry and Hiccup gets shocked.)

(The scene changes at the Blacksmith Shop with all the dragon riders. Hiccup places the dart onto a barrel.)

Hiccup: Someone's here.

Gobber: Huh?

(Tuffnut takes the dart.)

Hiccup: He managed to slip past our scouts and lay a trap in the woods.

Tuffnut: It ruined boy talk!

(Tuffnut throws the dart and it manages to hit a wooden box which Eret is carrying.)

Eret: Ohohh!

Gobber: Let me at 'em!

Hiccup: Slow down, Gobber. Let's get a search team on the ground. Scouts in the air. Toothless and I will fly the coastline.

(Eret is inspecting the dart for himself.)

Eret: Yeah. I wouldn't advise taking Toothless anywhere, Chief. I know this handy work. Grimmel the Grisly. Famous back where I'm from. The smartest dragon hunter I ever met. Well, next to me of course.

Hiccup: Well, he can't be that smart. He left his trap unmanned.

(Eret hands the dart to Astrid and she inspects it too.)

Eret: Haha. Nothing's accidental when it comes to old Grimmel. He lives for the hunt, to get inside the mind of his prey, to control its every choice. It's all a game to him.

Astrid: Well, he doesn't know who he's playing with.

Hiccup: Yeah. We've dealt with his kind before.

Eret: Don't underestimate him, Hiccup. Mark my words, he'll be back.

Hiccup: Then we'll be waiting for him.

(Scene cuts, inside the Haddock house at night with Hiccup alone.)

(Hiccup is searching for clues about the Hidden World in his Dad's journal and his map.)

Hiccup: Alright. Alright, come on give me a clue here. Give me a clue, Dad.

(While Hiccup looks through the notes, footsteps are heard from above the house and dust falls from the ceiling. Hiccup packs his map and the book away. He looks around his house and suddenly a floorboard creak is heard followed by a silhouette of Grimmel. Grimmel pours tea into a mug.)

Grimmel: Oh, I hope you don't mind if I help myself. This is, uh... quite good.

(Hiccup lights up Inferno.)

Grimmel: That is impressive. But let me finish my drink.

(Grimmel shoots a dart from his bow which hits the sleeping Toothless under bed covers.)

Hiccup: Toothless!

(Hiccup runs towards Toothless. Grimmel finishes his drink and looks proud of himself. He then loads another dart into his bow.)

Hiccup: What did you do to him?

Grimmel: Eh, nothing that he won't sleep off. (Sits on Stoick's chair) Ahh. Haha. May I? Chief Hiccup, hmm? Do I say Chief Hic-cup (makes hiccuping sound) or do I just call you Hiccup? What do you prefer?

(Hiccup slowly walks closer, with a stern look on his face.)

Grimmel: You have no idea who I am, do you? Uh- ha ha. Well, your father knew of me. Now, there was a chief. One of the greatest dragon hunters to have ever lived! What would he think of you? Huh-hah.

(Grimmel laughs)

Grimmel: He had it right, you know. Making it his mission to destroy the beasts so that you could grow up in a better world.

Hiccup: He changed his mind.

Grimmel: And look where that got him.

(Hiccup looks upset after that comment.)

Grimmel: So, let's get to the point. I am the Night Fury killer. I've hunted every last one but yours. You are going to give me that dragon. Or I will-

Hiccup: I will never give him up.

(Grimmel stands up and pushes Hiccup's Inferno out of his way, laughing. He starts walking towards Toothless.)

Grimmel: You wish dragons to live free among us, like equals? A toxic notion, my boy. History has shown that we are the superior species. What if word of your misguided ideas were to spread? It would be the undoing of civilization as we... know it. Hmm.

(Grimmel notices straw sticking out of Toothless' tail, so he kicks it slightly. This causes Fishlegs to wake up as he was hiding under the covers wearing a Toothless disguise.)

Fishlegs: Did we get him?

(Fishlegs faints and falls back to sleep. Hiccup uses his Inferno to throw Grimmel's bow away.)

Hiccup: Now!

(The Dragon Riders reveal themselves from their covers.)

Gobber: Sorry to barge in!

Hiccup: You think you can come into my home, sit in my father's chair, and threaten my dragon?! This is Berk, and we have defended our way of life from far worse than you!

Grimmel: Oh. Haha. A fighting spirit, I love it! Only, I'm afraid you're mistaken. You've never seen anything like me!

(Grimmel whistles, calling his Deathgrippers to attack the riders. One of Grimmel's Deathgrippers attacks from the roof, which causes Astrid, who was hiding on a wooden beam, to jump down to the floor of the house.)

Astrid: Ah!

Hiccup: Astrid, look out!

(The Deathgripper gets ready to strike with its tail but misses Astrid who is sitting on the floor. Astrid runs to the others. Grimmel whistles again, making another Deathgripper attack the riders.)

Valka: Look out! Son, get clear!

(Astrid runs, just missing the Deathgripper's acid.)

Astrid: Ugh!

Gobber: Run!

(Gobber runs out of the house, carrying Fishlegs)

Valka: Ah!

(Valka and Hiccup are still in the house. Valka uses her shield to block the Deathgripper's acid)

Grimmel: Have my dragon ready when I return, or I will destroy everything you love!

(Valka and Hiccup escape Hiccup's burning house but then see a view of all of Berk in flames.)

Viking 1: Inside!

Viking 2: It's the middle of the night!

Viking 3: What are we doing here?!

(Scene cuts to all of the Berkians inside the great hall at night, just after the attack.)

Hiccup: Alright! Alright, everybody! Settle down, please!

(Everyone keeps shouting and talking)

Hiccup: Fishlegs, have you ever seen that species of dragon before?

(Fishlegs, still dizzy after being shot by Grimmel's dart, nods in agreement but then faints and falls off his chair.)

Spitelout: Let me at 'em!

Viking: I'll give him a piece of my mind. And by mind, I mean fist!

(The Viking punches another Viking in the face.)

Hiccup: Did you miss the part where we almost died? Have you seen my house? This is a new kind of enemy and I underestimated him. Now, that's on me. But I will not do that again.

Snotlout: We're Vikings! We don't run from a fight. At least I don't.

(Snotlout points at Eret.)

Snotlout: You might.

Eret: I agree with Hiccup. We haven't seen the last of Grimmel. He's a predator, single-minded and patient. He won't stop until he gets what he wants.

Valka: I'm with Eret.

(Snotlout looks at Valka amazed and then angrily at Eret.)

Valka: We have to take this threat seriously.

Hiccup: Grimmel is just a sign of the times. Our enemies are getting smarter, more determined. We're not just overcrowded. We are exposed, and vulnerable. Short of full-blown war and risking everyone we love, I don't... I don't see a way of staying here any longer.

(Everyone starts talking. However, Astrid throws her axe on the table to get everyone's attention.)

Astrid: Hey! Hear him out!

(Astrid sits back down and nods at Hiccup.)

Hiccup: If we want to live in peace with our dragons, we need a better plan.

Gobber: So, what are you saying, Chief?

Hiccup: I'm saying we have to disappear. Off the map. Take the dragons to a place where no one will find them.

Male Viking: And where might that be?

Astrid: He's talking about a quest for the Hidden World.

Female Viking: The hidden what?

Ruffnut: Out to lunch.

Tuffnut: (laughs) Yeah.

Hiccup: My father was obsessed with it when I was a boy. He made notes and maps in search of the ancestral home of all dragons, tucked away somewhere beyond the edge of the world. It may be the solution we need. We're dragon people. It's where we belong.

(The Berkians don't sound like they can believe what Hiccup is saying.)

Hiccup: Look, I know this is our home. My father left me to protect it.

(Some of the Berkians look like they are starting to believe.)

Hiccup: But Berk is more than this place. We are Berk! The people! The dragons! I say Berk is wherever we go.

(The twins are sitting on a bench and look bored until Tuffnut jumps up.)

Tuffnut: I'm with him! Who else?!

(Scene changes in the sky with all the Berkians and their dragons on the adventure to The Hidden World.)

(On a ship, being carried by a dragon, a sheep is wearing a dragon outfit. It bleats proudly until he spots a dragon which makes it duck back in the ship.)

Fishlegs: Excuse me. Coming through. Just skipping through here. Fishmeat, eat your rocks. Eat your rocks.

(Fishlegs flies through with Fishmeat crying and excited.)

(Fishlegs gives Fishmeat a rock to eat. Fishmeat eats it vigorously)

Snotlout: Gah! People who fly with babies are the worst!

(Snotlout ducks as Fishmeat's lava blast hits Snotlout's seat.)

Gobber: I feel like I'm always asking you this question but- woah!

(Gobber suddenly loses control of his dragon, Grump.)

Gobber: Wake up, Grump! Wake up!

(Hiccup uses his spyglass to look at the horizon.)

Gobber: Is there an actual plan or--

Hiccup: Just keep flying until we reach the end of the world.

Gobber: Ah, seems sensible.

(The scene changes at Berk. All of the dragon trappers, warlords and Grimmel are on the empty island.)

Chaghatai: So? Where are they?!

Grimmel: Gone. Obviously.

Griselda: The Night Fury escaped you? Again!

Grimmel: I encouraged it. They've abandoned their only defensible position.

(Scene changes back with the Berkians.)

Grimmel: Running scared with what little they can carry.

Snotlout: Ugh. It just keeps going.

Tuffnut: That's because the world is actually round.

(Hiccup rolls his eyes, shakes his head and then keeps looking through his spyglass.)

Tuffnut: The Sun is round. Moon is round.

(Astrid chuckles, shakes her head and looks at Valka.)

(Toothless senses something.)

Tuffnut: Stars are round. Even though they're small and stupid.

(Ruffnut laughs.)

Tuffnut: Right? Stars.

(Scene changes back at Berk again.)

Grimmel: Don't fret. They won't get far. The Night Fury is distracted. I introduced him to your female.

(Scene changes back with the Berkians again. Toothless is sensing something again.)

Grimmel: Furies mate for life, you see.

Hiccup: What're you picking up on, bud?

(The Light Fury is seen to have been following the Berkians.)

Astrid: (gasps) The Light Fury!

Valka: She's following us!

Viking: Cool!

(The Light Fury shoots a plasma blast and turns invisible.)

Gobber: Would you look at that!

Tuffnut: Where did she go? Is she made of sky?

(Toothless flies to where the Light Fury turned invisible.)

Hiccup: Woah! Hold up, Toothless!

(Toothless, very excited, looks in all directions searching for the Light Fury. Hiccup looks behind and spots the Light Fury.)

Hiccup: Well, look who it is!

(However, the Light Fury looks angry and as if she is going to grab him.)

Hiccup: Uh...

(The Light Fury grabs Hiccup)

Hiccup: Aah! Hey. It's really nice to finally-

(The Light Fury throws Hiccup away and he falls down in the sky.)

Hiccup: Waaaaaah!

(The Light Fury looks at Toothless like she has done something really good. Toothless looks awkward and flies down to save his rider. The Light Fury looks stunned. Toothless saves Hiccup and flies back with the others.)

Hiccup: Not a word.

(Toothless looks at the sky, trying to see if the Light Fury is there again but she isn't, which makes him sad.)

(Scene changes back on Berk.)

Ragnar: Yeah yeah yeah. Yes. But where did they go?

Grimmel: (sighs) Do I have to explain this? Night Furies can't survive in the cold so they haven't gone north.

(Grimmel crosses off the north of the map.)

Grimmel: They're trying to put distance between themselves and enemies to the east and south...

(Grimmel crosses off the east and south on the map.)

Grimmel: ...And Night Furies cannot fly long distances without rest.

(While Grimmel was saying this, Hiccup discovers there is an island ahead of them on their search.)

Grimmel: Their flight path must include stops.

Fishlegs: Potty break!

(They fly to the island for a break.)

Grimmel: Therefore, they've gone... They can only have gone... Does anyone want to take a guess?

(Scene is back on Berk.)

Grimmel: Anyone? W-w-w-w-w?

Ragnar: Ah! East!

(Ragnar places a wooden boat on to east of the map)

Grimmel: West! Hmm? Simple, you see? Oh-ho, isn't this fun? Yes? No.

Griselda: Ugh.

(Griselda pushes Ragnar out of the way and walks off.)

Grimmel: Yes. Yes.

(Chaghatai also walks off in disappointment.)

Grimmel: Where's your love of the hunt? I thought you were conquerors! You'll have your prize, in time! Just allow me a few more days to enjoy this. I have dearly missed it.

(Scene cuts at the new island with the Dragon Riders.)

Hiccup: Alright! Looks like we're camping here for tonight.

Gobber: Well, thank Thor for that!

Tuffnut: Yes! My own place! I plan to build a hut. Only for the bearded! Ruffnut, you gotta stay out! Chin whiskers don't count!

(Snotlout is using his hands as a frame for his house.)

Snotlout: I see a tower of manliness in the shape of me. It's gonna be taller than Eret with bigger muscles.

(Eret ends up being in Snotlout's frame.)

Eret: Wha-what?

Snotlout: Get out of my house!

(Snotlout charges towards Eret.)

Eret: Hey! Is there a problem here?

Snotlout: Yeah, there's a problem...

(Snotlout steps onto a wooden box)

Snotlout: ...Ever since you showed up, you've been trying to upstage me. You're just so...

(Snotlout climbs up onto a barrel.)

Snotlout: Jealous! Delusional!

Eret: Ah, delusion's a good word for it.

Snotlout: Listen, Son of Eret! When Hiccup blows it as chief, I'm next in line. Number two...

(Snotlout puts up three of his fingers up.)

Snotlout: ...'cause I'm clearly Valka's favorite.

(Eret walks away, confused at what Snotlout is saying.)

Snotlout: So--better start--showing me respect!

(Snotlout points at Eret and wobbles on the barrel.)

Eret: Strange little man.

Gobber: Ah, don't mind him. It's not your fault you have the body of a Norse God. I, myself, have the same problem.

(Gobber stretches his back, but his back painfully cracks.)

Gobber: Aaah!

(Gobber picks up a tool and places it into the ground.)

Gobber: Blacksmith stall goes right here.

(Gobber discovers that several Hobgobblers have followed them.)

Gobber: Gaaah! One, two, three, four, five... where's...?!

(After Gobber has counted them, he walks back, scared, away from them.)

Hiccup: Oh, okay. Hold on, gang. I-I said make camp...

(Gobber walks toward the crowd, frantic. He accidentally bumps into Spitelout.)

Gobber: Do you see them?

Hiccup: ...not, build a new village.

Snotlout: Who died and made you chief?

(The crowd of Berkians are stunned by what Snotlout says.)

Snotlout: What?

(Gothi flies past Snotlout and smacks him with her staff.)

Snotlout: Oww!

Hiccup: Granted this place is very nice, but it's not the Hidden World.

Male Viking #1: We don't even know if this "hidden world" exists!

Male Viking #2: Yeah. This place is real!

(The Viking points at the ground. Valka approaches Hiccup to help him out.)

Valka: There's nothing more stubborn than a mob of tired, hungry Vikings.

Hiccup: (sighs) Well, I guess this could work as a base in the meantime. It's defensible. Hidden. Alright! You can stay!

Gobber: Say hello to New Berk!

(The crowd cheers.)

Gobber: Let's get building, lads!

Hiccup: Until Toothless and I find the Hidden World.

(The crowd feels discouraged and walks off to start building.)

Tuffnut: Now, about that voice. Can we lose the whole honking goose... thing? It's hard to imagine wedded bliss with that going off every minute. (chuckles)

Valka: If you're going to continue west, I should head back to make sure we weren't followed.

Snotlout: Great idea. I'll go with you. For protection.

Valka: No! You're far too important here.

Snotlout: Yeah...

Hiccup: Just, be careful.

(Valka looks like she is going to speak but then looks at Hiccup.)

Hiccup: What?

Valka: This plan... to hide us from the rest of the world, though--though I wish it were possible, I fear it can't last, Hiccup. And you know I tried to do the same for years. But greedy humans always find a way. I just... I only ask that you think about it.

(Valka pats Hiccup's left shoulder and walks off.)

Hiccup: Do you still think I'm crazy or...

Astrid: Let's just say, this whole idea is very...you.

Hiccup: Well, thanks for supporting me last night. It meant a lot.

(Astrid walks towards Hiccup with a book.)

Astrid: Don't thank me yet. I just hope you're right about this.

(Astrid hands Hiccup the book, which is actually the book with his father's notes inside.)

(Scene cuts at night in Hiccup's hut on New Berk.)

(Hiccup is sleeping with the book on his face. Toothless wakes up sensing something is close, causing Hiccup to fall and wake up.)

Hiccup: Toothless, no, it's too early.

(Toothless leaves Hiccup's hut and notices leaves moving, causing the curious Toothless to check them. He smells them and happily discovers that the Light Fury is very close. The Light Fury then appears, which makes Toothless really excited. The Light Fury growls and disappears again. Toothless follows her and they stare at each other before he bangs his head into something. Toothless loses sight of her but then spots her on the opposite side of a hut. The Light Fury runs off and so does Toothless. Hiccup leaves his hut, yawning.)

(The Light Fury flies very quickly while Toothless catches up, running. However, Toothless stops running just before a hill. The Light Fury lands beyond the hill watching Toothless perched on the hill. Toothless takes one step off the hill and falls down it crazily. Hiccup arrives but watches from where Toothless was perched on the hill. The Light Fury flirts at Toothless. Toothless discovers Hiccup is on the hill and watches him make flying gestures. Toothless flaps his wings, but the Light Fury only responds by licking herself. Toothless watches Hiccup do another dance but steps on a stick, causing it to snap and the Light Fury to look at the hill. She doesn't see Hiccup but feels suspicious. Toothless starts flapping his wings very quickly, but goes out of control and then causes the Light Fury to block herself from the sand. She then sneezes and Toothless gets frustrated at himself. He looks at Hiccup who is putting his thumb up and does a chicken dance. Toothless performs what Hiccup showed him but the Light Fury just watches. Then Toothless performs various strange dances, causing the Light Fury to get agitated and Hiccup to facepalm. When Toothless gets too close to the Light Fury, she hits him in the face. She then flies to a branch, hangs down from it and covers her face with her wings. Hiccup looks worried as Toothless walks to the start of the branch. Toothless points towards the end of the branch with his wing and then walks to the end of the branch. Toothless looks at Hiccup showing him a hand gesture suggesting the branch will snap. However, Toothless bounces up and down on the branch, causing the Light Fury to get more agitated. Toothless finally snaps the branch and falls off of it. The Light Fury, still hanging from the branch, covers her face with her wings again.)

(Hiccup waves his arms, trying to get Toothless' attention. Toothless looks at Hiccup and feels disappointed, but then spots part of the branch and starts drawing something with it in his mouth. This causes the Light Fury to feel curious, so she drops onto the ground and starts watching him draw. Toothless finishes drawing the Light Fury's face.)

Hiccup: Oh, now you can draw!

(The Light Fury steps onto Toothless' drawing and makes Toothless angry. The Light Fury growls, but then Toothless drops the branch from his mouth in awe and the Light Fury looks surprised. The Light Fury walks around the drawing to Toothless, and they stare at each other. Hiccup looks happy. Then the Light Fury walks away and takes off, inviting Toothless to follow her. She flies around Toothless while he runs across the rocks, unable to fly on his own. The Light Fury hovers and notices Hiccup is on the hill, which makes her angry and flies off. Toothless tries to fly off with her but he just falls into the lake. Toothless looks at his tail and splashes it into the water angrily. Hiccup looks upset and thoughtful.)

(Scene cuts in the morning on New Berk with Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless.)

(Hiccup is seen to be working on a prosthetic tail fin. Astrid looks at what Hiccup is doing and then looks at a diagram of a tail fin on a board.)

Astrid: Oh. Someone hasn't slept.

Hiccup Yeah. Well, that Light Fury won't let me within a mile of her.

(As Hiccup says this, Toothless scratches himself, causing his scales to shed and fall onto the ground. Astrid picks them up and walks to Hiccup.)

Hiccup: And neither of us will be getting any sleep or finding the Hidden World until Toothless takes over.

(Toothless pushes Hiccup out of the way to look through a magnifying glass.)

Hiccup: Hey! What do you think of that? Yeah.

(Hiccup pushes Toothless away and picks up a bowl.)

Astrid: You tried this once before. He didn't want it.

(Astrid drops Toothless' black scales into the bowl.)

Hiccup: Well, until now he didn't have a reason to. Right, bud?

(Toothless spits into the bowl and Hiccup mashes the scales.)

Astrid: Hm...

Hiccup: What?

Astrid: No. Nothing. I'm--I'm impressed. I mean, look at you. Embracing change. I am proud of you.

(Hiccup starts painting the prosthetic tail fin with the now black liquid from the bowl.)

Hiccup: Well, he's my best bud. I want him to be happy. And besides it's just until he brings her back.

(Hiccup kisses Astrid's head and picks up the new prosthetic tail fin. However, Astrid looks worried by what Hiccup said and shakes her head.)

Hiccup: Alright, fire when ready!

Gobber: Oh!

(Gobber is behind the tail fin as Toothless shoots a plasma blast at it, making Gobber's clothes singed and setting his mustache on fire.)

Gobber: Well, I guess you know the tail is fireproof.

(Gobber puts out the flame on his mustache, looks at Hiccup angrily and then walks off. Hiccup looks at Gobber sheepishly.)

Hiccup: Okay, Toothless.

(Toothless runs around crazily, excited for Hiccup to put the tail on.)

Hiccup: Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, I know. Shh, I know. Shhh.

(Toothless stops running around and allows Hiccup to attach the new tail.)

Hiccup: Okay, I know.

(Hiccup tries to attach the new tail, but Toothless moves his tail too much.)

Hiccup: Please, this is not helping.

Eret: Well, well, well. Someone's excited.

Hiccup: Uh, he's fresh off his first date. Now he's love-crazed.

(Hiccup manages to attach the tail but still tries to adjust some stuff.)

Gobber: Only we're the ones going crazy. The sooner he brings back that Light Fury, the better.

Hiccup: Yeah, but to do that, he'll need to fly without me. So, time to give this new and improved baby a shot.

(Hiccup finishes and Toothless tries expanding the tail, making him happy.)

Hiccup: Attaboy! Looking sharp, Toothless. So, what do you think, bud? Bring her home (impersonates Stoick) by sundown at the latest.

(Toothless pushes his head into Hiccup, licks his face, and then gives him a hug.)

Hiccup: No, save it for your girlfriend! Go on, get out of here!

(Hiccup urges Toothless to leave with a light push. Toothless starts running off but stops as he doesn't think it's right. He turns around and looks at Hiccup.)

Hiccup: It's okay.

(Toothless replies excited and then flies off. As he is flying he looks at his new tail fin and then looks at Hiccup who is smiling. Everyone around Hiccup stops working and looks at him in shock. Hiccup takes a heavy sigh and then everyone starts working again.)

(Scene changes in the sky with Valka and Cloudjumper. It is foggy.)

(Valka discovers they have been followed by Grimmel, the Warlords and their Dragon Trappers. Valka spots Grimmel's Airship and then one of Grimmel's Deathgrippers attacks Valka, followed by another one.)

Valka: Watch out!

(Cloudjumper grabs the incoming Deathgripper and throws it at the other Deathgripper.)

Valka: Go, Cloudjumper!

(Grimmel stops his Deathgrippers from attacking Valka by whistling. They stop and Valka and Cloudjumper escape just in time.)

(Scene cuts in the sky with Toothless searching for the Light Fury.)

(As Toothless searches, he thinks he can see the Light Fury but instead, it is just his own shadow on a cloud. He hears a sound and flies towards it until he finally finds the Light Fury, making him very happy and stare at her for a while. Toothless shows the Light Fury his new tail by closing and expanding it. This makes the Light Fury happy. They fly into a vortex and the Light Fury shoots a plasma blast, flies through it which makes her invisible. She then invites Toothless to do the same. Toothless tries two times but fails. Toothless feels sad and looks at the Light Fury who encourages him. Determined, he closes his eyes and extends his glowing blue back spines Suddenly, electricity and lightning appear out of Toothless' body. He roars, attract lightning from the thunderstorm and turns invisible. When he turns visible again, he feels tired and falls down in the sky. The Light Fury catches him and then Toothless flies on his own again. Next, they fly with each other, romantically. They fly up together in the shape of a love heart. Toothless licks the Light Fury's face and then they fly back down again. The Northern lights are seen and they touch each other's wings. Toothless looks very happy for himself. They arrive at a huge waterfall and then the Light Fury pulls Toothless down into the hole of the waterfall.)

(Scene cuts at night with all the Berkians having a party on New Berk.)

Vikings: For the Chief.

Vikings: To the Chief.

(A group of Berkians put their mugs up in the air and then drink from their mugs. Some Berkians are throwing Hiccup up in the air in celebration.)

Hiccup: Yeah, okay, guys! Now I'm just getting sick! Okay. Ha. Ha. Ha.

(Hiccup looks like he is going to be sick on Gobber.)

Gobber: Don't say I thought you were a little off your raw for this but it isn't half bad.

Hiccup: This is supposed to be a temporary solution.

Eret: It's unanimous.

(Eret picks up a chicken drumstick.)

Eret: Everyone agrees we've definitely traded up.

(Eret barges Hiccup with his arm.)

Eret: Well done, Chief. 

(Hiccup fake laughs while Eret leaves and eats the chicken drumstick.)

Hiccup: What if the tail broke? What if Grimmel found him? What if... he needs me?

Gobber: Would you relax? He's probably having the time of his life.

Hiccup: How would I know? She never comes around. And when she does, she's always rushing off. I'm saying how-how do we know if she's right for us.

Gobber: Us?

Hiccup: You know what I mean. She's so wild and skittish. I'm just gonna say it, I don't trust her.

(Gobber laughs.)

Gobber: Can't tame them all, Hiccup. One day, you'll have to snip those apron strings and let Toothless stretch his wings. Reminds me of a talk I had with Stoick about you. Gaaah!

(The Hobgobblers appear out of nowhere again and there seems to be more and more each time.)

Gobber: Where do they keep coming from?!

(Gobber hides behind a hut.)

Hiccup: Who?

(Gobber points at the Hobgobblers.)

Gobber: Those bloody Hobgobblers.

(Hiccup looks towards where Gobber points but the Hobgobblers have disappeared.)

Gobber: I swear, they're popping up faster than rabbits.

(Gobber comes out of his hiding place and whispers at Hiccup.)

Gobber: I think they want to eat me. Evidence would suggest that I'm tasty.

Tuffnut: Hiccy! A moment? Listen, I've been watching you walk. Lose the limp. No one's gonna marry that. (chuckles)

Hiccup: I have a prosthetic leg!

Gobber: So have I!

Tuffnut: And I have parasitic twin, but you don't see me limping around about it! Come on.

(Tuffnut tries to make Hiccup keep his chin up.)

Tuffnut: Chin up, Hiccy!

(Tuffnut pats Hiccup's chest but Hiccup doesn't approve of it so he pushes Tuffnut's hand away.)

Tuffnut: Pop out that chest!

(Hiccup walks away and then Tuffnut slaps Hiccup's butt.)

Tuffnut: Move that butt to the left a little bit!

(Gobber, who was staying out of it and stayed back, hears a noise and then turns around. He discovers that even more Hobgobblers have appeared.)

Gobber: Wooooo!

(Gobber runs away as fast as he can.)

(Valka and Cloudjumper arrive back at New Berk.)

Hiccup: Mom! Are you hurt? What happened out there?

Valka: I don't know how, but Grimmel is tracking us.

Gobber: Gaaah! This is all because of the Hobgobblers!

Valka: He has a hundred ships, maybe more. With enough cages for all our dragons.

(Hiccup sighs and thinks of something to do.)

Hiccup: If Grimmel is leading them here, we have to take him out of the mix.

Tuffnut: Uh... and how would we do that?

Hiccup: By going there to capture him.

Gobber: Capture him?

(Tuffnut jumps with his arms up in the air.)

Tuffnut: I'm with him! Who else?!

(Scene cuts at night in Grimmel's temporary base with his Deathgrippers.)

(One of his Deathgrippers has put its stinger into the top of a glass and is releasing its own venom into it. The Deathgripper takes its stinger out of the glass. Grimmel pours the venom from the glass into a tube and then places the tube into one of his darts. The riders, which are wearing their dragon flight suits, are flying to Grimmel's temporary base. Hiccup, who has been riding on Stormfly, jumps off, flies to the base and lands on it. Grimmel is still working on something before his Deathgrippers sense that the riders are close. He clicks his fingers, making his Deathgrippers defend him and his base. The riders appear from behind rocks.)

Snotlout: Okay. Split up, we'll be harder to catch.

Eret: I was thinking we should split up... just because.

Valka: I like your instincts.

(The Riders walk-off individually and split up.)

Snotlout: What is this?!

(The Riders walk stealthily inside of Grimmel's tower. Astrid throws a stone to the opposite side of the building, misleading a Deathgripper. Tuffnut is very visible until Ruffnut pulls him down barely before a Deathgripper spots him. Hiccup runs upstairs and arrives in Grimmel's room with his Inferno lit. Hiccup doesn't see him inside Grimmel's room anywhere. Unexpectedly, a net falls down and covers the base. Hiccup runs out of the room and Fishmeat starts screaming.)

Fishlegs: Shh. Shh. Quiet!

(Hiccup is out of Grimmel's room and finds Grimmel on the other side of the net.)

Grimmel: Where's your dragon when you need him? Hmm, Chief? Must have forgotten all about you. (laughs) First rule of the hunt: Separate the prey from its pack. You've just removed yourselves from the equation.

Hiccup: Why are you doing this?

Grimmel: Really? I didn't think you cared. Well, unlike you, when I was a boy and I came up on a Night Fury, I killed it where it slept! That simple act of courage made me a hero in my village. So, I decided to kill every last one, bringing real peace to the people of this world. Until you came along preaching that dragons are something other than thieves and murderers. Psssh. That nonsense dies now. Starting with you.

Hiccup: But you have dragons of your own.

(Grimmel laughs at Hiccup's comment.)

Grimmel: These? They're dragon killers, drugged into obedience with their own venom. Not even your precious Alpha could control them. They serve me...

(Grimmel pushes a drug into the Deathgripper next to him.)

Grimmel: ...and only me. Allow me to demonstrate.

(Grimmel whistles.)

Hiccup: Take cover!

(A Deathgripper shoots its acid at the stairs which Hiccup is standing on but Hiccup goes up to them just in time.)

Astrid: Split up!

(They split up, running. Astrid gets targeted by a Deathgripper and tries to climb up the net. She just manages to get on top of a section of the net before the Deathgripper jumps on top too. Hiccup jumps and flies onto the chains from the now destroyed stairs. He tries to climb up them but has to swing to a wall before he gets killed from falling. The Deathgripper shoots its acid burst at Hiccup but he just manages to dodge it and get on top. Valka is being attacked by the Deathgrippers and dodges their acid bursts by using her staff. She is right at the top of the building and swings her staff around to call for help.)

Valka: Up here!

(Astrid is climbing up a wall and dodges a Deathgripper's attacks. She swings on a Deathgripper's tail, kicks it in its face and climbs up the wall again. Cloudjumper arrives at the top of the building and tries to pull the net off of it)

Valka: Hurry!

(All the Riders except Hiccup are on the top of the building and get rescued by their dragons.)

Snotlout: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Valka: Hiccup!

(However, Hiccup is still quite far from the top and doesn't look like he will make it as he realizes there is a big drop. He walks back a few steps, runs and then takes a leap just before a Deathgripper kills him. But then he gets saved by his mother.)

Valka: Gotcha! Go, Cloudjumper!

(They escape but the Deathgrippers are still trapped in the burning building because of the net. Suddenly, the Crimson Goregutter appears.)

Fishlegs: Yeah! Our hero!

(The Crimson Goregutter rams into the building and destroys it into pieces with the Deathgrippers falling down with it, too. Grimmel escapes his crumbling tower and watches the Riders fly away in anger. Fishmeat is screaming again and Ruffnut suddenly comes out of the building as well.)

Ruffnut: Ugh. He takes that stupid baby everywhere.

(Grimmel looks at Ruffnut in shock and realizes it is a Dragon Rider.)

(Scene cuts, back on New Berk with the Dragon Riders.)

(The Dragon Riders arrive back at New Berk.)

Gobber: Thor Almighty. Guess we won't be needing this then, huh?

(Gobber points at a wooden structure)

Hiccup: I led us right into his trap.

Tuffnut: Yeah, nice work, Chief. Right, Ruff?

(However, they realize that Ruffnut is not standing next to Tuffnut.)

Hiccup: Wait...

Tuffnut: Uh...

(Tuffnut's eyes widen at the sudden realization.)

Hiccup: Where is Ruffnut?

Fishlegs: We--we left her behind!

Astrid: How could you not notice she was missing? You ride a two-headed dragon.

Tuffnut: Oh, yeah. I feel like how Ruffnut is everyday... Dumb.

Gobber: Odin be spanked! This just gets better and better.

Tuffnut: I try to avoid looking at her because she gives me acid reflux.

Hiccup: O-Okay guys! Just keep your helmets on! Toothless and I will fly--

Viking: Toothless has the Light Fury now! He's probably not even coming back.

Hiccup: What?

Astrid: You gave him his freedom, Hiccup. What were you expecting?

Hiccup: I never thought he'd stay away for good! I-I... Ah... Look, I'll figure it out. I just need more time.

(Hiccup walks away on his own.)

Valka: He thinks he has to lead alone. Well, because his father had to.

(Hiccup, still walking away, drops his helmet onto the ground.)

Valka: He doesn't realize the strength you have together. Do you still believe in him?

Astrid: Of course. I wish he did, but he thinks he's nothing without Toothless.

Valka: Then help him realize the truth.

(Hiccup looks stressed and struggles to think. Astrid suddenly appears in front of him on Stormfly.)

Astrid: Get on!

Hiccup: What?

Astrid: We're going to find him.

(Astrid offers him a ride by holding out her hand.)

Hiccup: Really?

(Hiccup grabs her hand. The Riders hear a sound and turn around to see Hiccup and Astrid flying on Stormfly.)

Hiccup: Everybody, stay put! We will get Ruffnut back! Don't worry!

Tuffnut: Pffft. Worry? If they're stuck with Ruffnut, I'm more worried about them. (chuckles)

(Scene cuts, with Ruffnut, Grimmel, and the Warlords in another base.)

(Ruffnut has been captured and is standing in a prison cell, relaxed.)

Ruffnut: Why the long face? (laughs) I mean, mine's long, but yours is really long. All face and no brain. Like you got stretched at birth. Do you have a twin, too? Tuffnut took up all the room in Mom's belly. Otherwise, I'd have a rounder head and more brains, that's science.

(Grimmel starts getting annoyed at her but keeps working on what he's doing. Ruffnut sits down.)

Ruffnut: My braids are like little Zipplebacks, see.

(Ruffnut starts playing with her braids.)

Ruffnut: Rawr-rawr. Yeaaah. Even the mold spots look like eyes. So cute. They even have little horns and everything just like Barf and Belch. Except me and Barf can't stand Belch so they're really just Barfs. It's warm in here.

(Ruffnut stands up and walks to the cage door.)

Ruffnut: I know what you're thinking. You've never had a prisoner this hot.

(Ruffnut sits down again. Grimmel looks more annoyed.)

Ruffnut: All the boys love me. Except Eret, who totally lost his chance. That ship has sailed, boys, sorry. And Hiccup is practically married to that round head, Astrid. But Snotlout and Fishlegs, they're basically in my hand.

(Grimmel's pencil snaps and he becomes even more annoyed. Ruffnut is now swinging upside down.)

Ruffnut: Just can't choose, you know. Snotlout's a beefcake but almost too pretty, you know. Sometimes I think he's more in love with himself than me. There's only room for one beauty in this relationship. (laughs and walks to cage bars between her and a Scuttleclaw's cage) Fishlegs would keep me alive longer if I had to eat one of them. Stranded on some glacier somewhere. But he never shuts up about dragons. Do you hate it when people never stop talking?

Grimmel: Yyyeeessss, I dooo.

(Ruffnut swings again.)

Ruffnut: Bleh, bleh, bleh. It's sooo boring.

Griselda: Can't we just feed her to your dragons?

Ruffnut: What do you have to eat around here? I'm allergic to fish, you should know that. That's all they have in that stupid new island.

(Grimmel looks alert when Ruffnut says this.)

Ruffnut: Do you have any clams? They're like little mouths with slimy food inside that's already chewed like the way Mom used to do it.

Grimmel: ENOUGH!

(Grimmel shoves everything out of his way.)

Ruffnut: Until I turned twelve and she was like... "CHEW YOUR OWN FOOD!" And I was like, "NO I DON'T LIKE IT!"

(Grimmel opens Ruffnut's cage door.)

Grimmel: Most annoying creature ever to cross my path!

Ruffnut: Awww...

(Ruffnut strokes her hair and starts poking Grimmel's face with her Zippleback braids.)

Ruffnut: Oops. You let the dragons out. Gonna get ya. Gonna get ya. No, this one's gonna get ya.

(Grimmel stops Ruffnut by blocking his face with his hand. Chaghatai then opens the Scuttleclaw's cage and Grimmel throws Ruffnut's helmet at her.)

Grimmel: Take him and go, please! I beg you! The Deathgrippers will have to forego dinner.

Ruffnut: Ewww. You feed your dragons... dragons?

Grimmel: GO!

Ruffnut: Where's your bathroom? I gotta... (makes click sound)

(Grimmel turns and looks at Ruffnut, angrily.)

Ruffnut: Okay! Gods! No wonder you have grey hair.

(Ruffnut puts her helmet on and sits on the Scuttleclaw's back.)

Ruffnut: Stress is not good for you. Ha ha ha! So long, losers!

(Ruffnut has flown off and Grimmel looks devious.)

(Scene cuts, in the sky and above the ocean with Hiccup and Astrid riding Stormfly. They are still searching for Toothless.)

Hiccup: Where--where is she heading?

Astrid: She's tracking something, aren't you, girl?

(Stormfly flies closer to the ocean.)

Hiccup: There's nothing but miles and miles of--

(Suddenly, they notice water spray above the ocean and keep heading towards it. When they get closer, they find out it is a huge waterfall.)

Hiccup: A great waterfall--

Astrid: At the end of the world.

(They look at each other, stunned, and then Stormfly flies into the waterfall.)

Astrid: Stormfly!

(They enter the hidden world after flying through the waterfall. Stormfly scents' an entrance to the mushroom forest of the hidden world. They fly over bright blue water and then enter a section of the hidden world where there are tall pillars with bioluminescence. Stormfly starts to glow. Hiccup laughs.)

Astrid: Wow!

Hiccup: Look! (points at the edge of the cliff)

(They continue flying. When they fly past some dragon eggs, the eggs glow and the baby dragons become visible. They then fly with hundreds of thousands of Fireworms and try to touch some. Then, they arrive at the center point of the Hidden World, which is the throne room for the king of dragons. Astrid gasps. Astrid spots a dragon which is very close so she tries to hide and land somewhere. They land and start walking.)

Hiccup: It really does exist.

(Lots of dragons are flying above them so they try and lay low. They stop walking and lay down at the edge of a cliff, watching the dragons fly inside the hidden world. On a high part of the hidden world, Toothless is with the Light Fury.)

Hiccup: Toothless.

Astrid: Shhh. You'll spook them.

(Toothless and the Light Fury fly down from where they were and fly around with a group of dragons flying behind them. A few dragons watch and roar on the ground. Toothless and the Light Fury land on a gigantic crystal, looking over a large part of the Hidden World. All the dragons that are standing on the ground roar for Toothless. Toothless roars very loudly.)

Astrid: Now that's a king.

(After roaring, Toothless turns around and looks at the Light Fury, happily. The Light Fury walks to Toothless and then they both start flirting. Next, they sit side by side and watch the crowd of dragons bow for their king and queen. Hiccup looks upset as he realizes the truth for the future. Astrid looks at Hiccup and tries to comfort him.)

Hiccup: We should go.

(Suddenly, they find out a Rumblehorn is behind them.)

Hiccup and Astrid: (At the same time) Oh, no.

(They stand up and walk backwards away from the dragon just before stepping off. Hiccup tries to tame the dragon by holding out his hand but the dragon roars, causing all of the dragons to be aware of danger especially Toothless.)

Astrid: Stormfly!

(Hiccup and Astrid jump off of the cliff and slide down the cliff face. Toothless flies towards them and stops the other dragons from coming with him. The Light Fury looks worried and confused. As Hiccup and Astrid slide down, they dodge the dragons trying to attack them. They fall to the bottom of the cliff on their hands but stand up quickly.)

Astrid: Go! Go!

(They run away from the Rumblehorn which is still chasing them. Toothless pushes the dragons out of the way, trying to save Hiccup and Astrid. Toothless just manages to grab them.)

Hiccup: I-I'm sorry bud. I-I-I just--

(Toothless stops more dragons from attacking them and then they all escape safely. The scene fades out on Hiccup's face who looks depressed.)

(The scene fades into a flashback of Hiccup who notices his father, Stoick, is crying in front of the fireplace. Stoick realizes Hiccup is in the room.)

Stoick: Son! (wipes his tears away) You should be asleep.

Hiccup: I was thirsty.

Stoick: Yeah, come here.

(Hiccup climbs downstairs and runs to his dad. Stoick lifts Hiccup onto his lap and allows him to use tongs for the fire.)

Hiccup: Dad? Are you gonna get us a new mom?

(Stoick hugs Hiccup and kisses his head.)

Stoick: I don't want another. Your mom was the only woman for me. She was the love of my life. But with love comes loss, son. It's part of the deal. Sometimes it hurts, but in the end, it's all worth it. There's no greater gift than love.

(The flashback fades out on Stoick's heartfelt face.)

(Scene fades in, back with Hiccup, Toothless and Astrid all looking upset. They land back on New Berk with Toothless still unhappy. Hiccup looks at Toothless and then at the building being built on New Berk. Hiccup turns to Astrid who gives him a sympathetic look. Hiccup sighs and walks in front of Toothless.)

Hiccup: It's okay, bud. You belong there, with her. We don't.

(Toothless agrees but doesn't seem happy about it.)

Hiccup: And that's alright.

(Hiccup touches Toothless' face.)

Hiccup: We'll find a way to man--

(Unexpectedly, Toothless turns around quickly. He senses something and finds out the Light Fury has followed them. Toothless gets very excited.)

Hiccup: Hey! (Toothless licks his face and he laughs.) She followed us back!

(Toothless runs to the Light Fury and she jumps playfully on him.)

Hiccup: We might not have to say goodbye after all.

(Toothless licks the Light Fury before running back to Hiccup; however, the Light Fury stays where she is. Toothless makes a gentle sound, tries to convince her to follow him. The Light Fury looks at where Hiccup and Astrid are and slowly starts to follow Toothless.)

Hiccup: That's it.

(Ruffnut appears on the Scuttleclaw.)

Ruffnut: Woohoo! Yeah!

(Hiccup and Astrid turn around.)

Astrid: Ruffnut?

(She gets off the dragon and throws her helmet away.)

Ruffnut: Miss me?

Astrid: How did you escape?

Ruffnut: I annoyed them till they let me go.

Hiccup: Wai-wait... Grimmel LET you go?

Ruffnut: So dumb. They couldn't handle me. See, everyone thinks Tuffnut's more annoying but--

Astrid: But hold on.

Hiccup: Ruffnut! Focus. Were you followed?

Ruffnut: I never look back, Hiccup.

Hiccup: (gasps) Toothless!

(He runs to Toothless. Meanwhile, Toothless and the Light Fury are still slowly walking.)

Hiccup: Toothless!

(The Light Fury senses danger and quickly flies off the island and tell Toothless to follow her. Nonetheless, the Light Fury gets hits by a dart and starts falling. Toothless runs to save her, but she falls to the ground and slides to the edge of the cliff.)

Hiccup: Toothless! Come back!

(However, Toothless continues to run towards the Light Fury but then Grimmel appears and points his bow at Toothless. Toothless gets ready to fire a plasma blast but Grimmel shoots first, knocking him unconscious.)

Hiccup: No!

(Grimmel chains Toothless and the Light Fury up just before Hiccup could get to him. Grimmel flies away on his Airship. Astrid and Ruffnut catch up to Hiccup.)

Grimmel: Now our little game must come to an end.

(Berk's dragons fly towards Grimmel's airship to protect their Alpha.)

Grimmel: Call them off, Alpha! (mounts onto his harpoon and aims it at the Light Fury) No reason for her to die too!

(Toothless notices the dragons are flying to him, so he roars at them to prevent them from flying too close to him. They stop flying. The rest of the riders arrive at the scene.)

Snotlout: What are they doing? They could totally take him!

Hiccup: Not with her life on the line.

(Toothless roars at Grimmel's Deathgrippers to try to make them fly away too, but they threaten Toothless instead.)

Grimmel: Save your breath! The only Alpha they respond to is me!

(Toothless gives up and looks at Hiccup.)

Grimmel: Awww, don't feel too badly. You tried your best! But, you are nothing without your dragon.

(Grimmel whistles, causing his Deathgrippers to fly to the other dragons and prevent them from flying past them. Grimmel flies away and Toothless urges the other dragons to follow him anyway. They follow and Hiccup runs to the edge of the cliff.)

Hiccup: Toothless!

(Hiccup stops running and watches as the dragons fly away. He then starts pacing around.)

Tuffnut: Oh, that is just... ugh, great! Now what?

Snotlout: I think it's time (Pushes Eret's arm) for number two to become number one.

Valka: (Puts a hand on Astrid's shoulder) He'll listen to you.

(Astrid nods and starts walking up to Hiccup.)

Hiccup: (Keeps pacing around and sees Astrid) Don't say it.

Astrid: (Holds up both her hands) I wasn't going to.

Hiccup: I shouldn't have dragged you out there. He wouldn't have flown me back. She wouldn't have followed.

Astrid: Yep.

Hiccup: Aah! I feel like the same screw up I was before I met Toothless.

Astrid: I can see that.

Hiccup: (Stops walking and looks at Astrid) Are you just gonna stand there and agree with everything?

Astrid: Well, you're right. You're back to where you started. But I was the first to believe in you. And I have watched you doubt whether you're worthy ever since. But you know what? I am the person I am today because of you. I never told you that, but it's true. You are the bravest, most stubborn, most determined...knucklehead I know. Toothless didn't give you that, Hiccup. He just made it--

Hiccup: Easier.

Astrid: And now it's gonna be a lot harder. So... what are you gonna do about it?

Hiccup: (shrugs) Probably something stupid.

Astrid: That's the Hiccup I know.

(Hiccup kisses Astrid on the cheek and walks towards the riders.)

Hiccup: Suit up, gang! We're gonna get them back.

Fishlegs: What?

Ruffnut: He's lost his mind.

Tuffnut: Now that's (hugs Hiccup) marriage material. At last, faithful pupil, you are ready.

(Hiccup and Tuffnut nod at each other.)

Fishlegs: Umm. How are we gonna get our dragons back... without dragons?

Hiccup: Trust me.

(The dragons arrive at the Dragon Trapper ships. Cloudjumper lands on a ship.)

Dragon Trapper: Move! (Pokes Cloudjumper with a staff but Cloudjumper roars at the trapper)

(Toothless roars at Cloudjumper to stop him from getting angry.)

Grimmel: Umm. That's right, Alpha. No surprises.

(Toothless reluctantly growls at Cloudjumper, telling him to go into the cage. He goes into the cage and knocks two trappers over. Lots of dragons are also locked inside cages.)

Ruffnut: So... jump off the cliff... in these. (Expands her dragon flight suit.) That's the best you've got?

Hiccup: No. You guys are the best I've got.

Ruffnut: Aww. (Strokes her hair.) I'm with him, who else?

Tuffnut: Ruffnut... that was my line.

Hiccup: Let's go!

(Hiccup and Astrid run to the edge of the cliff.)

Astrid: Try to keep up!

(They both jump off of the cliff and expand their dragon flight suits, flying to the Dragon Trapper ships.)

Astrid: Woohoo!

Tuffnut: Woo!

Ruffnut: Woohoo!

Snotlout: Yeah!

Fishlegs: Woah!

Tuffnut: I'm doing it!

(The rest of the gang jump off of the cliff and fly to the Dragon Trapper ships.)

(Grimmel starts to lower Toothless down while the Warlords are preparing to collect him. Toothless growls at Ragnar when he's about to touch him)

Grimmel: Aww. (laughs) You didn't think I'd actually hand you the night fury, did you? He's mine to kill.

Griselda: That snake!

Grimmel: I intend to finish what I started. Best of luck controlling them without an Alpha.

Hiccup: Hold on, Toothless!

(Grimmel turns around and sees the riders gliding towards them with their flight suits.)

Tuffnut: Waa-ah--wah

(Tuffnut grabs Ruffnut's foot then she kicks him out)

Ruffnut: Let's go!

Snotlout: Aagh! I could have used some practice!

Fishlegs: Oh, I should have skipped breakfast!

(Grimmel turns around with his harpoon at the ready, only to be knocked off his seat by Hiccup. Grimmel grabs onto a wooden part of the harpoon while the other Dragon Riders fly past him. Hiccup, spinning around, expands his flight suit, flies past some ships, then grabs onto some rope to swing himself around.)

Hiccup: Toothless!

(Toothless, hearing Hiccup, roars at Cloudjumper, who then bursts from his cage and breathes fire at the Dragon Trappers. Grump and Skullcrusher also get freed and all three dragons start flying back to the island. Toothless roars at Cloudjumper, who understands, then goes to the island with Grump and Skullcrusher. At the same time, Hiccup, Tuffnut, Ruffnut, Astrid and Fishlegs land on a boat ready to fight. Fishmeat snarls.)

Hiccup: Perfect timing!

(Astrid gets a weapon out from a wooden box of weapons and Hiccup lights up Inferno. All the Dragon Trappers start running towards them.)

Hiccup: Game faces!

(The riders look at Snotlout who is hanging from a wooden dragon by its teeth thanks to his cape.)

Snotlout: Yeah, what are you waiting for? Get in there! 

(Hiccup sighs and the Dragon Riders head into battle.)

Fishlegs: Yeah!

(The gang knocks off a few hunters. Meanwhile, Toothless rips off his muzzle and roars at Grimmel, who mounts onto his harpoon and aims it at Toothless. However, once he sees Toothless charging a plasma blast, he leaps out of the way as Toothless’ blast destroys one of the airship arms, sending it spiraling. Grimmel clings to the falling airship and WHISTLES a command to his Deathgrippers, but Toothless shoots another blast and the Deathgrippers start struggling to keep the airship aloft.)

(Below, Astrid battles a soldier on a gangway. He parries her blow and corners her, raising his sword for the kill, when...)

Hiccup: Heads up!

(...Hiccup cuts a nearby rigging line, releasing a sail boom that sweeps through and sends the soldier flying off of the gangway.)

Astrid: Thanks. Look out!

(Astrid throws a hammer towards Hiccup, who dodges as it whizzes past him and takes out a soldier who was about to attack Hiccup.)

Hiccup: Thanks.

(Astrid grabs a canister from Hiccup's belt, bites off the wax seal and tosses it to the deck below. Then, Hiccup throws his Dragon Blade into the gas cloud. Soldiers panic and flee as a fireball erupts, framing the couple with an explosion behind them.)

(Astrid whistles to call Stormfly and points to the sky, then to Hiccup. Stormfly swoops in and plucks Hiccup, carrying him towards the airship, that is engulfed in flames and dropping steadily. A freed Deathgripper bumps into Stormfly, knocking Hiccup out of her grasp and throwing him through the air until he grabs onto the airship.)

Hiccup: I'm coming, Toothless!

(Grimmel shimmies down the chain to the Light Fury.)

Grimmel: You still think he cares about you?!

(He puts a vial of venom into the Light Fury’s collar, subduing her into obedience.)

Grimmel: Let's just see who he follows!

(He releases the latch, springing the Light Fury from her restraint. She flies off, groggy and obedient, carrying Grimmel on her back. Toothless watches, raging and struggling against his ties.)

(Hiccup launches himself into the air until he grasps Toothless' chain and climbs down through the ties until he's next to Toothless' head.)

Hiccup: I'm sorry, bud! For everything!

(He takes off Toothless' collar.)

(Just as the flaming airship crashes into the sea, Hiccup pulls the release latch, freeing Toothless. Suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless come out of the water flying and tear off in pursuit of Grimmel and the Light Fury.)

Hiccup: Now let's go get her!

(The remaining Deathgrippers head after them.)

(A soldier yells a battle cry and charges the Gang. Tuffnut clocks him from behind, then hurls his war hammer to Snotlout, who takes out another soldier, then...)

Snotlout: Number two, coming through!

(...tosses his hammer back to Tuffnut, who effortlessly uses it to knock out yet another.)

Tuffnut: Surprise! Sorry about that!

Snotlout: Come on!

(Snotlout rolls over the tussle and grabs the hammer,bringing itdown heavily to smash the lock off of a cage,freeing the Gorecutter within.)

Snotlout: Yeah! One more freed, four to go! Try to keep up!

(The Goregutter roars and takes to the air, passing Fishlegs engaged in combat on an upper deck.)

Fishlegs: I got your backs! (He pushes his adversary off of the deck then, seeing his friends about to be attacked by a horde of soldiers below, grabs a line and hook, and swings down to their rescue, knocking over soldiers like a wrecking ball. He lands and eyes the damage, impressed.) Yeah! It's almost like we're a team!

(The line and heavy hook swing back, knocking Fishlegs to the deck and sending Fishmeat tumbling from his pouch. Ivar raises his sword to the baby.

Ivar: Oh. You brought a baby to a battle?

Fishlegs: Uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I were you.

(They look up to the Goregutter, roaring with rage as he flies in to protect Fishmeat. He crashes through the masts, bringing a storm of wreckage down upon the fleeing soldiers.)

Ivar: Look out!

(Fishlegs beams, placing Fishmeat back into his pouch.)

Fishlegs: God, I love that dragon.

(The Warlords look on in shock, then turn to find themselves confronted by Eret, Gobber, and Valka, who have now arrived on their respective dragons. They brandish their weapons in invitation.)

Gobber: Sorry, we're late for the party.

(The Warlords pull out their swords.)

Chaghatai: You're right on time.

(Grimmel steers the Light Fury past billowing clouds, with Hiccup and Toothless in pursuit. He looks back and grins.)

Grimmel: That's it. That's it.

(He passes a bank of storm clouds, spotting the rocky spires of New Berk in the distance. He veers off toward them. Toothless fires at Grimmel, but he rolls the Light Fury, forcing her to take the impact of the blast against her wing. She yelps in pain.)

Hiccup: How are we going to get him off her back without hurting her?

(Tuffnut surprises a soldier, dropping to the deck in front of him.)

Tuffnut: Fear the facial hair!

(The soldier swipes impulsively ,slicing through Tuffnut's "beard." It drops away from his chin in two halves. He gasps, causing him scream in rage and chase the terrified soldier across the deck. Where Gobber and Ragnar are trading blows.)

Gobber Oh, I have missed this!

Ragnar: Me too!

(Ragnar knocks Gobber to the deck,then pauses to notice Hobgobbler staring eerily from the railing.)

Gobber: See that there?

Ragnar: Aw, cute.

Gobber: That's a bad omen. You're cursed.

(Suddenly, the Hobgobbler shrieks, signaling a horde of Hobgobblers to pour over the railing and chew apart the deck like hungry piranha. Ragnar screams and flees for his life as Gobber laughs.)

Gobber: Yes! Good on ye! (He notices a Hobgobbler chewing on his peg-leg.) Eh, I guess you’re not so bad after all.

(Astrid silently appears behind the Helmsman and deftly knocks him out. She then spins the ship's wheel and sinks her axe into the deck, bracing the wheel into a sharp turn. The decks leans heavily to port as the flag ship collides with the battle ship to her left, beginning a chain reaction.)

Trapper: Abandon ship!

(Dragon cages slide across the pitched deck, colliding and furthering the chaos. Griselda and Chaghatai become trapped in one of them. Freed dragons take to the air. The Rescue Team has succeeded. The battle is won.)

Astrid: Yeah!

(Grimmel leads the chase through the tall, craggy rocks of New Berk. Toothless and Hiccup zigzag behind, closing in. Suddenly, the four remaining Deathgrippers appear from behind a rocky spire, bombarding Hiccup and Toothless.)

Hiccup: Uh, we've got problems.

(One of them tries to hit Hiccup with his claw, but Toothless rolls and hits the Deathgripper with his wings. Then he blasts a passing rocky arch, burying another Deathgripper in an explosion of boulders.)

(They keep chasing Grimmel, but the Deathgrippers keep bumping into Toothless, trying to make him fall. Meanwhile, on the ground below, the Berkians watch the pursuit with rapt intensity.)

Viking: Take him down, Hiccup!

(The crowd cheers for their chief. One of the Deathgrippers clamps onto Toothless and tries to stab him with his stinger.)

Hiccup: We need a better plan!

(The second Deathgripper holds Toothless by his right side.)

Hiccup: And quick!

(The third Deathgripper grabs Toothless' left side, making him unable to move. Toothless comes up with an idea. He splits his dorsal plates apart and static begins to crackle between them.)

Hiccup: Uh, what... what are you doing?

(Amazed, Hiccup sees patches of Toothless' scaly skin begin to turn mirror-like, including the Toothless scales on his own dragon armor. It suddenly dawns upon him what Toothless is attempting.)

Hiccup: Okay... okay.

(Toothless focuses and roars, commanding lightning to arc from the stormy sky and strike them as they drop from the sky. In a flash, they disappear and the Deathgrippers are electrocuted. The Berkians gasp in awe as they watch the lightning blast illuminate the sky, followed by a complete disappearance of Hiccup and Toothless.)

(Grimmel looks back, baffled to see his lifeless Deathgrippers dropping from the sky. He looks around frantically. Suddenly, Hiccup and Toothless re-materialize in front of him at close range and Toothless roars. Hiccup leaps toward Grimmel, throwing open the wings of his armor.)

Hiccup: AAGGH!

(Grimmel shoots a dart from his crossbow. Hiccup twists in the air, avoiding it, but the dart hits Toothless, making him yelp in pain and knocking him unconscious. Hiccup crashes into Grimmel, knocking him off of the Light Fury's back.)

Grimmel: AAGGH! You'll kill both of us! Fighting over a dragon? That's your plan?!

(Hiccup watches in terror as Toothless falls from the sky. With Grimmel clinging to him, Hiccup makes a desperate choice.)

Hiccup: This is.

(Hiccup takes off the Light Fury's drug collar and drops it. She shakes off the grogginess, regaining full awareness and turns to Hiccup.)

Hiccup: Save him.

(He lets go, plummeting with Grimmel. Distressed, the Light Fury watches him, but then shrieks to let Hiccup know she understood and races off to rescue her mate. As Hiccup falls, Grimmel clings to him in vain. But Hiccup is only focused on Toothless, watching as the Light Fury rescues him from his fall and hauls him safely to a cliff-top.)

(Hiccup smiles, relieved. Then Grimmel grabs him and begins tearing apart his leather wings. Hiccup tries to kick him away, but Grimmel clings to his prosthetic leg. Then Hiccup hears a sound growing closer. He looks up to see the Light Fury racing towards him. He thinks fast and detaches his prosthetic leg, freeing himself from Grimmel.)

Grimmel: AAH! NOOOOOO!

(Grimmel crashes into the sea with an explosive splash as the Light Fury swoops in and grabs Hiccup at the last second. Hiccup looks up, stunned. The Light Fury looks under her belly to meet his eyes and coos.)

Hiccup: See? I knew you'd come around.

(The Light Fury carries Hiccup to the cliffs and drops him close to Toothless and lands on the grass. The rest of the riders, the Berkians and their dragons arrive, whooping and cheering. Hiccup stands up and hops, one-legged, towards Toothless, then falls to his knees and caresses his nose with his finger.)

Hiccup: Hey, good morning, bud.

(Toothless starts to regain consciousness after being sedated by Grimmel.)

Hiccup: Here you go.

(Hiccup sits down to pat Toothless' head.)

Hiccup: Boy, you are full of surprises.

(The Light Fury walks over to Hiccup and Toothless, Hiccup putting his hand on the Light Fury.)

Hiccup: He's all yours.

(Standing himself up, Hiccup hops back to Astrid, who supports him. The Light Fury helps Toothless stand up while all the dragons and Vikings look on. Gobber and Eret both chuckle at each other, while Snotlout is not looking impressed.)

Valka: You know, Eret may be blessed with brawn but, just between us, you have the brains.

Snotlout: Number one.

(Hiccup and Astrid, both smiling, nod at each other and press their heads together. Toothless, after walking past the Light Fury, looks at Hiccup, who smiles at him. Toothless looks towards the horizon and back to Hiccup again. Hiccup also looks at the horizon and back to Toothless. He then hops to Toothless and holds his face.)

Hiccup: You're right, bud. It's time. I was so busy fighting for a world that I wanted, I didn't think about what you needed.

(Hiccup looks at the Light Fury.)

Hiccup: You've looked after us for long enough. Time to look after yourselves.

(Astrid looks at Stormfly and takes her saddle off.)

Astrid: Oh, Stormfly, my good girl.

(Gobber takes his saddle off of Grump.)

Gobber: All right, Grumpy. Off you go.

(Eret takes his saddle off of Skullcrusher.)

Eret: So long, you big ugly beast. I'll miss you.

(All the other dragon riders take off their saddles.)

Valka: Oh, Cloudjumper. Oh.

(Tuffnut nudges Ruffnut, who looks at him sadly. After watching this, Hiccup looks back at Toothless again.)

Hiccup: Go on, bud. Lead them to the Hidden World. You'll be safe there. Safer than you could ever be with me. It's okay. (Places his head on Toothless' head.) I love you too. And I want you to be free. Our world doesn't deserve you... yet.

(Toothless hugs Hiccup.)

Hiccup: Go, Toothless. Go.

(Hiccup places his hand on Toothless' snout and then moves his hand away from Toothless. Hiccup nods and then Toothless roars, followed by all the dragons on the island. The Light Fury flies off the island to the Hidden World first, followed by the other dragons except Toothless. Toothless turns his head to Hiccup who nods and then he flies off the island with the other dragons. The Riders walk to Hiccup as he smiles at the dragons.)

(The scene cuts to three months later, where the villagers attend Hiccup and Astrid's wedding as they finally get married. Hiccup and Astrid join hands and smile at each other. Gobber holds a bouquet of flowers and wipes away a tear on his face. Gothi covers Hiccup and Astrid's joined hands with a ceremonial cloth and taps the cloth with her staff. Hiccup and Astrid kiss each other.)

Spitelout: To the chief and chieftess!

(The villagers all cheer.)

Villagers: Yeah!

(Gobber throws the bouquet of flowers and Eret catches them. He looks surprised but then smiles. Snotlout wipes away a tear and starts crying.)

Tuffnut: Come, cry into my full thick beard.

(Snotlout buries his face in Tuffnut's braided beard and continues crying.)

Fishlegs: (crying) Oh, it's so beautiful!

Ruffnut: Gross.

Fishlegs: Oh... (He hugs Ruffnut and continues crying.)

Ruffnut: Okay, you win. I like sensitive guys. (She hugs Fishlegs back.)

Villager #1: Oh-ho-ho!

Villager #2: Yeah!

Hoark: Finally, right?

(Later, the newlyweds stand on a cliff face and look out toward the horizon, soon joined by Gobber, Valka, and the other Dragon Riders. Hiccup and Astrid put an arm around each other and lean their heads, wearing thoughtful expressions.)

(Epilogue scene cuts to nine years later. A young boy with blond hair, revealed to be Hiccup and Astrid's son, is held by a now-bearded Hiccup sailing a boat. Meanwhile, Astrid and their daughter, a young red-haired girl, raise one of the sails as the boat journeys across the sea.)

Hiccup (v.o.): There were dragons when I was a boy. Oh, there were great grim sky dragons that nested on the cliff tops like gigantic scary birds. Little brown scuddly dragons that hunted down the mice and rats and well-organized packs. Preposterously huge sea dragons that were 20 times as big as the big blue whale. Some say they crawled back into the sea leaving not a bone or a fang to remember them. Others say they were nothing but folk tales to begin with. I'm okay with that.

(Hiccup suddenly notices something through a thick fog and then discovers Toothless and the Light Fury sitting on a small island with three baby dragons of their own. Toothless, now wild, notices the strange-looking bearded man on the boat. He flies over and lands on the bow of the boat and gives Hiccup a wary look.)

Hiccup: Hey. Hey there, bud. Remember me?

(Toothless continues to eye Hiccup suspiciously and slowly advances toward him. The two children cringe in fear and hide their faces while Astrid comforts them.)

Astrid: It's okay.

(Hiccup holds out his hand while turning his head away. Toothless sniffs Hiccup's hand and immediately recognizes his old friend. He then embraces Hiccup while tackling him to the deck of the boat.)

Hiccup: Oh! Ah! Oh-ho-ho. Hey, I'm glad to see you, too, bud.

(Toothless jumps around Hiccup excitedly. Astrid shows a relieved look on her face.)

Astrid: Ah! He's not gonna eat your father.

(Toothless starts licking Hiccup's bearded face.)

Hiccup: How's the tail holding up? Could probably use some oil and little fine-tuning.

Astrid: Look, it's okay. They're friends.

(The two children look up and watch. Toothless nuzzles Hiccup's face and licks him again.)

Hiccup: Ah! Come on!

(Toothless turns his gaze to Hiccup and Astrid's children.)

Hiccup: Here.

Astrid: Go on. It's alright.

(Astrid gently nudges the two children and they nervously approach Toothless.)

Hiccup: Come. He won't hurt you. Hold your hands out. Like this. That's it.

(Hiccup helps them each hold out a hand. The two children cover their faces in fear.)

Hiccup: Let him come to you.

(Toothless gently presses his snout against the two children's hands. They both gasp and look amazed. Later, Hiccup and his son fly on Toothless. Hiccup throws his son at one point and then catches him. The Light Fury flies beside them with her three baby dragons. One baby dragon does an invisibility maneuver and reappears. Astrid and her daughter fly on Stormfly and whoosh past Toothless. Hiccup gives Toothless a gentle pat, and Toothless catches up to Stormfly.)

Hiccup (v.o.): Legend says that when the ground quakes or lava spews from the earth, it's the dragons letting us know they're still here, waiting for us to figure out how to get along.

(Hiccup's son dismounts and rides on Stormfly, while Astrid's daughter dismounts and rides on Toothless.)

Hiccup (v.o.): Yes, the world believes the dragons are gone, if they ever existed at all. But we Berkians... we know otherwise. And we'll guard the secret until the time comes when dragons can return in peace.

(All the dragons fly off into the cloud-filled sky.)

"TITANIC"

                                      Screenplay by

                                      James Cameron

                

               BLACKNESS

               Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing 
               brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-
               falling toward us like express elevators.

               One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL 
               FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, 
               bristling with insectile manipulators.

               TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the 
               limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then 
               stars. Then gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP

               PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR 
               ONE, right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants.

               INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with 
               equipment. ANATOLY MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched 
               over his controls... singing softly in Russian.

               Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late 
               forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit 
               unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering 
               his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking treasure 
               hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part 
               adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he 
               is propped against the CO2 scrubber, fast asleep and snoring.

               On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a 
               bearded wide-body named LEWIS BODINE, who is also asleep. 
               Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is 
               the resident Titanic expert.

               Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast 
               adjustment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

               A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit 
               from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor 
               in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its 
               two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIR ONE

               Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing.

                                     ANATOLY
                              (heavy Russian accent)
                         We are here.

               EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO

               MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS

               Skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and 
               the THRUM of big thrusters.

               The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrolls in the lights 
               of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, 
               where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly 
               lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center 
               port.

                                     BODINE
                         Come left a little. She's right in 
                         front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. 
                         Thirteen... you should see it.

                                     ANATOLY
                         Do you see it? I don't see it... 
                         there!

               Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of 
               the ship appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at 
               us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It 
               towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 
               years ago.

               THE TITANIC

               Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow 
               railing, intact except for an overgrowth of "rusticles" 
               draping it like mutated Spanish moss.

               TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock 
               Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME.

                                     LOVETT
                         It still gets me every time.

               The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's 
               shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. 
               Anatoly turns.

                                     ANATOLY
                         Is just your guilt because of stealing 
                         from the dead.

               CUT WIDER

               To show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning 
               it in his hand so it points at his own face.

                                     LOVETT
                         Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.

               Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, 
               with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length.

                                     LOVETT
                         It still gets me every time... to 
                         see the sad ruin of the great ship 
                         sitting here, where she landed at 
                         2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, 
                         after her long fall from the world 
                         above.

               Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles 
               and watches the sonar.

                                     BODINE
                         You are so full of shit, boss.

               Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge 
               anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless 
               forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid 
               out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The 
               22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous 
               wreck.

                                     LOVETT (V.O.)
                         Dive nine. Here we are again on the 
                         deck of Titanic... two and a half 
                         miles down. The pressure is three 
                         tons per square inch, enough to crush 
                         us like a freight train going over 
                         an ant if our hull fails. These 
                         windows are nine inches thick and if 
                         they go, it's sayonara in two 
                         microseconds.

               Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the 
               Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck 
               hous nearby.

                                     LOVETT
                         Right. Let's go to work.

               Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs 
               the joystick controls of the ROV.

               OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot 
               called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward.

                                     BODINE (V.O.)
                         Walkin' the dog.

               Snoop Dog drives itself away from the sub, paying out its 
               umbilical behind it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video 
               cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an 
               open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand 
               Staircase.

               Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into 
               the First Class Reception Room.

               SNOOP'S VIDEO POV

               Moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the 
               ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance 
               move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow 
               dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites 
               of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural 
               grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly 
               undersea mansion can be seen again.

               MONTAGE STYLE

               As Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:

               A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side 
               against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.

               A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... 
               glinting as Snoop moves around it.

               Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne 
               bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-
               top "granny shoe". Then something eerie: what looks like a 
               child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll.

               Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here 
               and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate 
               piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of 
               the past.

               THE ROV

               Turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, 
               the sitting room of a "promenade suite", one of the most 
               luxurious staterooms on Titanic.

                                     BODINE
                         I'm in the sitting room. Heading for 
                         bedroom B-54.

                                     LOVETT
                         Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up 
                         like you did yesterday.

                                     BODINE
                         I'm tryin' boss.

               Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-
               perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls 
               over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing 
               desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room 
               toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, 
               scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves 
               out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going.

                         I'm crossing the bedroom.

               The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a 
               dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the 
               porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in 
               the dark.

                         Okay, I want to see what's under 
                         that wardrobe door.

               SEVERAL ANGLES

               As the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving 
               debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright 
               as they were in 1912.

                                     LOVETT
                         Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.

               Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, 
               and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a 
               cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears 
               and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door...

                         Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what 
                         I'm seein'?

               CLOSE ON LOVETT

               Watching his monitors. By his expression it is like he is 
               seeing the Holy Grail.

                                     LOVETT
                         Oh baby baby baby.
                              (grabs the mike)
                         It's payday, boys.

               ON THE SCREEN

               In the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a 
               small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KELDYSH - DAY

               THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto 
               the deck of a ship by a winch cable.

               We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV 
               KELDYSH. A crowd has gathered, including most of the crew of 
               Keldysh, the sub crews, and a hand-wringing money guy named 
               BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited partners. There is 
               also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his 
               moment of glory.

               Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two 
               is being lowered into its cradle on deck by a massive 
               hydraulic arm. Mir One is already recovered with Lewis Bodine 
               following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the safe like a 
               kid on Christmas morning.

                                     BODINE
                         Who's the best? Say it.

                                     LOVETT
                         You are, Lewis.
                              (to the video crew)
                         You rolling?

                                     CAMERAMAN
                         Rolling.

               Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling 
               the safe's hinges. During this operation, Brock amps the 
               suspense, working the lens to fill the time.

                                     LOVETT
                         Well, here it is, the moment of truth. 
                         Here's where we find out if the time, 
                         the sweat, the money spent to charter 
                         this ship and these subs, to come 
                         out here to the middle of the North 
                         Atlantic... were worth it. If what 
                         we think is in that same... is in 
                         that safe... it will be.

               Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find 
               yet. The door is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett 
               moves closer, peering into the safe's wet interior. A long 
               moment then... his face says it all.

                                     LOVETT
                         Shit.

                                     BODINE
                         You know, boss, this happened to 
                         Geraldo and his career never 
                         recovered.

                                     LOVETT
                              (to the video cameraman)
                         Get that outta my face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION ROOM - DAY

               Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe 
               and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely. 
               Nearby, other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed 
               and preserved.

               Buell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett 
               is yelling at the video crew.

                                     LOVETT
                         You send out what I tell you when I 
                         tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, 
                         not 60 minutes. Now get set up for 
                         the uplink.

               Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett.

                                     BUELL
                         The partners want to know how it's 
                         going?

                                     LOVETT
                         How it's going? It's going like a 
                         first date in prison, whattaya think?!

               Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth.

                                     LOVETT
                         Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in 
                         the safe... no, look, don't worry 
                         about it, there're still plenty of 
                         places it could be... in the floor 
                         debris in the suite, in the mother's 
                         room, in the purser's safe on C 
                         deck...
                              (seeing something)
                         Hang on a second.

               A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side 
               with a tong... revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of 
               a woman.

               Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent 
               shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated. The 
               woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered. In her late 
               teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a 
               kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool 
               of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled 
               in the lower right corner is the date: April 14 1912. And 
               the initials JD.

               The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond 
               necklace with one large stone hanging in the center.

               Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab 
               table. It is a period black-and-white photo of a diamond 
               necklace on a black velvet jeweler's display stand. He holds 
               it next to the drawing. It is clearly the same piece... a 
               complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost 
               heart-shaped.

                                     LOVETT
                         I'll be God damned.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     LOVETT
                         Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is 
                         not just A shipwreck, Titanic is THE 
                         shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of

               INT. HOUSE / CERAMICS STUDIO

               PULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on 
               a TV set in the living room of a small rustic house. It is 
               full of ceramics, figurines, folk art, the walls crammed 
               with drawings and paintings... things collected over a 
               lifetime.

               PANNING to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house. 
               Outside it is a quiet morning in Ojai, California. In the 
               studio, amid incredible clutter, an ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing 
               a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red clay covers her 
               hands... hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but still 
               surprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties 
               assists her.

                         I've planned this expedition for 
                         three years, and we're out here 
                         recovering some amazing things... 
                         things that will have enormous 
                         historical and educational value.

                                     CNN REPORTER (V.O.)
                         But it's no secret that education is 
                         not your main purpose. You're a 
                         treasure hunter. So what is the 
                         treasure you're hunting?

                                     LOVETT (V.O.)
                         I'd rather show you than tell you, 
                         and we think we're very close to 
                         doing just that.

               The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled 
               mass, her body shapeless and shrunken under a one-piece 
               African-print dress.

               But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young 
               girl.

               Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery 
               clay from her hands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and 
               comes in with her.

               The younger woman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her.

                         rights and even ethics. Many are

                         robbing. I have museum-trained experts

                         team are able to preserve it intact. 
                         Should this have remained unseen at 
                         the bottom of the ocean for eternity,

                                     LOVETT
                         This is Brock Lovett. What can I do 
                         for you, Mrs...?

                                     BUELL
                         Rose Calvert.

                                     LOVETT
                         ...Mrs. Calvert?

                                     ROSE
                         I was just wondering if you had found 
                         the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. 
                         Lovett.

               Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked 
               expression...

                                     BUELL
                         I told you you wanted to take this 
                         call.

                                     LOVETT
                              (to Rose)
                         Alright. You have my attention, Rose. 
                         Can you tell me who the woman in the 
                         picture is?

                                     ROSE
                         Oh yes. The woman in the picture is 
                         me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering 
               across the ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is 
               no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the 
               distance.

               CLOSE ON A WINDOW

               Of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible, looking 
               out calmly.

               Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being swung over the 
               side to start a dive.

                                     BODINE
                         She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. 
                         Like that... what's her name? That 
                         Anastasia babe.

                                     BUELL
                         They're inbound.

               Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the 
               approaching helo.

                                     BODINE
                         She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, 
                         right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on 
                         the Titanic. At the age of 17. If 
                         she'd've lived, she'd be over a 
                         hundred now.

                                     LOVETT

                                     BODINE
                         Okay, so she's a very old goddamned 
                         liar. I traced her as far back as 
                         the 20's... she was working as an 
                         actress in L.A. An actress. Her name 
                         was Rose Dawson. Then she married a 
                         guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar 
                         Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's 
                         dead, and from what I've heard Cedar 
                         Rapids is dead.

               The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to 
               yell over the rotors.

                                     LOVETT
                         And everybody who knows about the 
                         diamond is supposed to be dead... or 
                         on this ship. But she knows about 
                         it. And I want to hear what she has 
                         to say. Got it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF 
               hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to 
               the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking 
               unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying 
               FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh 
               crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose 
               does not travel light.

               HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking 
               impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy 
               deck crew and gigantic equipment.

                                     BODINE
                         S'cuse me, I have to go check our 
                         supply of Depends.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian 
               room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, 
               arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and 
               Bodine are in the doorway.

                                     LOVETT
                         Is your stateroom alright?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes. Very nice. Have you met my 
                         granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care 
                         of me.

                                     LIZZY
                         Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, 
                         grandma. Remember, up on deck?

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, yes.

               Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. 
               Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general 
               glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and 
               grandchildren, her late husband.

                                     ROSE
                         There, that's nice. I have to have 
                         my pictures when I travel. And Freddy 
                         of course.

                         I should like to see my drawing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA

               Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting 
               herself across a span of 84 years. Until they can figure out 
               the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed. 
               It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.

               TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing.

               FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly 
               creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two 
               efficient lines.

               THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING

               Dancing under the water.

               FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a 
               sketching pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. 
               Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct.

               Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of 
               the necklace in his hand.

                         Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous 
                         stone, called the Blue Diamond of 
                         the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, 
                         about the time Louis lost everything 
                         from the neck up. The theory goes 
                         that the crown diamond was chopped 
                         too... recut into a heart-like 
                         shape... and it became Le Coeur de 
                         la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today 
                         it would be worth more than the Hope 
                         Diamond.

                                     ROSE
                         It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

                              drawing)
                         I only wore it this once.

                                     LIZZY
                         You actually believe this is you,

                         I tracked it down through insurance 
                         records... and old claim that was 
                         settled under terms of absolute 
                         secrecy. Do you know who the claiment 
                         was, Rose?

                                     ROSE
                         Someone named Hockley, I should 
                         imagine.

                                     LOVETT
                         Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh 
                         steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace 
                         his son Caledon Hockley bought in 
                         France for his fiancee... you... a 
                         week before he sailed on Titanic. 
                         And the claim was filed right after 
                         the sinking. So the diamond had to've 
                         gone down with the ship.
                              (to Lizzy)

                         If your grandma is who she says she 
                         is, she was wearing the diamond the 
                         day Titanic sank.
                              (to Rose)
                         And that makes you my new best friend. 
                         I will happily compensate you for 
                         anything you can tell us that will 
                         lead to its recovery.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. 
                         I know how hard it is for people who 
                         care greatly for money to give some 
                         away.

                                     BODINE
                              (skeptical)
                         You don't want anything?

                                     ROSE
                              (indicating the drawing)
                         You may give me this, if anything I 
                         tell you is of value.

                                     LOVETT
                         Deal.
                              (crossing the room)
                         Over here are a few things we've 
                         recovered from your staterooms.

               Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane 
               to valuable. Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see 
               over the table top. With a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise 
               shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl. She caresses 
               it wonderingly.

                                     ROSE
                         This was mine. How extraordinary! It 
                         looks the same as the last time I 
                         saw it.

               She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in 
               the cracked glass.

                                     ROSE
                         The reflection has changed a bit.

               She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau 
               brooch.

                                     ROSE
                         My mother's brooch. She wanted to go 
                         back for it. Caused quite a fuss.

               Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade 
               butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb. She 
               turns it slowly, remembering. We can see that Rose is 
               experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain 
               dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.

               WRECK fill the screens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the 
               two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN.

                         Live from 12,000 feet.

               Rose stares raptly at the screens. She is enthralled by one 
               in particular, an image of the bow railing. It obviously 
               means something to her. Brock is studying her reactions 
               carefully.

                                     BODINE
                         The bow's stuck in the bottom like 
                         an axe, from the impact. Here... I 
                         can run a simulation we worked up on 
                         this monitor over here.

               Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's 
               computer. As he is calling up the file, he keeps talking.

                                     BODINE
                         We've put together the world's largest 
                         database on the Titanic. Okay, here...

                                     LOVETT
                         Rose might not want to see this, 
                         Lewis.

                                     ROSE
                         No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.

               Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, 
               which parallels his rapid-fire narration.

                                     BODINE
                         She hits the berg on the starboard 
                         side and it sort of bumps along... 
                         punching holes like a morse code... 
                         dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's 
                         flooding in the

                                     BODINE
                         forward compartments... and the water 
                         spills over the tops of the bulkheads, 
                         going aft. As her bow is going down, 
                         her stern is coming up... slow at 
                         first... and then faster and faster 
                         until it's lifting all that weight, 
                         maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out 
                         of the water and the hull can't 
                         deal... so SKRTTT!!
                              (making a sound in 
                              time with the 
                              animation)
                         ...it splits! Right down to the keel, 
                         which acts like a big hinge. Now the 
                         bow swings down and the stern falls 
                         back level... but the weight of the 
                         bow pulls the stern up vertical, and 
                         then the bow section detaches, heading 
                         for the bottom. The stern bobs like 
                         a cork, floods and goes under about 
                         2:20 a.m. Two hours and forty minutes 
                         after the collision.

               The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose 
               watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without 
               emotion.

                                     BODINE
                         The bow pulls out of its dive and 
                         planes away, almost a half a mile, 
                         before it hits the bottom going maybe 
                         12 miles an hour. KABOOM!

               The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation 
               now follows the stern.

                                     BODINE
                         The stern implodes as it sinks, from 
                         the pressure, and rips apart from 
                         the force of the current as it falls, 
                         landing like a big pile of junk.
                              (indicating the 
                              simulation)
                         Cool huh?

                                     ROSE
                         Thank you for that fine forensic 
                         analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the 
                         experience of it was somewhat less 
                         clinical.

                                     LOVETT
                         Will you share it with us?

               Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far 
               below them.

               A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat 
               deck. Rose recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in 
               place. She hears ghostly waltz music. The faint and echoing 
               sound of an officer's voice, English accented, calling "Women 
               and children only".

               FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium 
               and terror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. 
               Just impressions... flashes in the dark.

               Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted, 
               debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of 
               doorways sliding past, like dark mouths.

               IMAGE OF A CHILD

               Three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the middle 
               of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying.

               Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her 
               eyes well up and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly.

                                     LIZZY
                              (taking the wheelchair)
                         I'm taking her to rest.

                                     ROSE
                         No!

               Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady 
               is gone, replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett 
               signals everyone to stay quiet.

                                     LOVETT
                         Tell us, Rose.

               She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined 
               ship.

                                     ROSE
                         It's been 84 years...

                                     LOVETT
                         Just tell us what you can --

                                     ROSE
                              (holds up her hand 
                              for silence)
                         It's been 84 years... and I can still 
                         smell the fresh paint. The china had 
                         never been used. The sheets had never 
                         been slept in.

               He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her.

                                     ROSE
                         Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. 
                         And it was. It really was...

               As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE 
               DISSOLVE / MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912...

                                                            MATCH DISSOLVE:

               EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK - DAY

               SHOT CONTINUES IN A FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white 
               superstructure of Titanic rises mountainously beyond the 
               rail, and above that the buff-colored funnels stand against 
               the sky like the pillars of a great temple. Crewmen move 
               across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer.

               Southampton, England, April 10, 1912. It is almost noon on 
               sailing day. A crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to 
               Titanic like ants on a jelly sandwich.

               IN FOREGROUND a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings 
               into frame, hanging from a loading crane. It is lowered toward 
               HATCH #2.

               On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move 
               slowly through the dense throng. The atmosphere is one of 
               excitement and general giddiness. People embrace in tearful 
               farewells, or wave and shout bon voyage wishes to friends 
               and relatives on the decks above.

               A white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes 
               through the crowd leaving a wake in the press of people. 
               Around the handsome cars people are streaming to board the 
               ship, jostling with hustling seamen and stokers, porters, 
               and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials.

               The Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open 
               the door for a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and 
               purple outfit, with an enormous feathered hat. She is 17 
               years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with piercing 
               eyes.

               It is the girl in the drawing. Rose. She looks up at the 
               ship, taking it in with cool appraisal.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't see what all the fuss is 
                         about. It doesn't look any bigger 
                         than the Mauretania.

               A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car 
               for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder 
               Hockley's fortune. "Cal" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond 
               meaning.

                                     CAL
                         You can be blasé about some things, 
                         Rose, but not about Titanic. It's 
                         over a hundred feet longer than 
                         Mauretania, and far more luxurious. 
                         It has squash courts, a Parisian 
                         cafe... even Turkish baths.

               Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT 
               BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth 
               is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent 
               Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household 
               with iron will.

                                     CAL
                         Your daughter is much too hard to 
                         impress, Ruth.
                              (indicating a puddle)
                         Mind your step.

                                     RUTH
                              (gazing at the 
                              leviathan)
                         So this is the ship they say is 
                         unsinkable.

                                     CAL
                         It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't 
                         sink this ship.

               Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special 
               experience.

               This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned 
               out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, 
               complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a 
               tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge 
               TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose.

               A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by 
               last minute loading.

                                     PORTER
                         Sir, you'll have to check your baggage 
                         through the main terminal, round 
                         that way --

               Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes 
               dilate. Five pounds was a monster tip in those days.

                                     CAL
                         I put my faith in you, good sir.
                              (curtly, indicating 
                              Lovejoy)
                         See my man.

                                     PORTER
                         Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.

               Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses.

                                     LOVEJOY
                              (to the porter)
                         These trunks here, and 12 more in 
                         the Daimler. We'll have all this lot 
                         up in the rooms.

               The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous 
               pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second 
               car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles 
               frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running.

               Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly 
               checks his pocket watch.

                                     CAL
                         We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.

               He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They 
               move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind 
               them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent 
               purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers.

               Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying 
               passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well-
               wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the 
               smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated 
               boarding bridge, twenty feet above.

               They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool 
               and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in 
               a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, 
               checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.

               They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a 
               wooden Biograph "cinematograph" camera mounted on a tripod. 
               DANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) 
               is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY 
               MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious.

                                     DANIEL
                         Look up at the ship, darling, that's 
                         it. You're amazed! You can't believe 
                         how big it is! Like a mountain. That's 
                         great.

               Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad 
               Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised.

               Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past 
               him. And he is bumped again a second later by the boys' 
               father.

                                     CAL
                         Steady!!

                                     MAN
                         Sorry squire!

               The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting.

                                     CAL
                         Steerage swine. Apparently missed 
                         his annual bath.

                                     RUTH
                         Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever 
                         booking everything at the last 
                         instant, we could have gone through 
                         the terminal instead of running along 
                         the dock like some squalid immigrant 
                         family.

                                     CAL
                         All part of my charm, Ruth. At any 
                         rate, it was my darling fiancee's 
                         beauty rituals which made us late.

                                     ROSE
                         You told me to change.

                                     CAL
                         I couldn't let you wear black on 
                         sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.

                                     ROSE
                         I felt like black.

               Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded 
               down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for 
               Titanic's Victualling Department.

                                     CAL
                         Here I've pulled every string I could 
                         to book us on the grandest ship in 
                         history, in her most luxurious 
                         suites... and you act as if you're 
                         going to your execution.

               Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them... a 
               great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her 
               forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with 
               a sense of overwhelming dread.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         It was the ship of dreams... to 
                         everyone else. To me it was a slave 
                         ship, taking me back to America in 
                         chains.

               CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION

               As it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up 
               the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         Outwardly I was everything a well 
                         brought up girl should be. Inside, I 
                         was screaming.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A SCREAMING BLAST

               From the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, 
               bellowing their departure warning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC - DAY

               A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above 
               the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. The 
               steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton.

               PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, 
               and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is 
               crowded with dockworkers and ship's crew.

               Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR 
               MEN, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand.

               JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a 
               glance as the other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is 
               American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for 
               the standards of the times. He is also unshaven, and his 
               clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, 
               and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He 
               is also very self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having 
               lived on his own since 15.

               The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish.

                                     OLAF
                              (subtitled)
                         You stupid fishhead. I can't believe 
                         you bet our tickets.

                                     SVEN
                              (subtitled)
                         You lost our money. I'm just trying 
                         to get it back. Now shutup and take 
                         a card.

                                     JACK
                              (jaunty)
                         Hit me again, Sven.

               Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand.

               EXTREME CLOSEUP JACK'S EYES

               They betray nothing.

               CLOSE ON FABRIZIO

               Licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card.

               EXTREME CLOSEUP STACK

               In the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four 
               counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on 
               top of the money are two 3RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC.

               The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning.

                                     JACK
                         The moment of truth boys. Somebody's 
                         life's about to change.

               Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds 
               his close.

                                     JACK
                         Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. 
                         Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh 
                         oh... two pair... mmm.
                              (turns to his friend)
                         Sorry Fabrizio.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         What sorry? What you got? You lose 
                         my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di 
                         cazzo --

                                     JACK
                         Sorry, you're not gonna see your 
                         mama again for a long time...

               He slaps a full house down on the table.

                                     JACK
                              (grinning)
                         'Cause you're goin' to America!! 
                         Full house boys!

                                     FABRIZIO
                         Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

               The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack 
               rakes in the money and the tickets.

                                     JACK
                              (to the Swedes)
                         Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a 
                         pair. I'm high and you're dry and...
                              (to Fabrizio)
                         we're going to --

                                     FABRIZIO / JACK
                         L'AMERICA!!!

               Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to 
               clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops 
               backward onto the floor and sits there, looking depressed. 
               Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around, 
               and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.

               Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and 
               rides him around the pub. It's like they won the lottery.

                                     JACK
                         Goin' home... to the land o' the 
                         free and the home of the real hot-
                         dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' 
                         in high style now! We're practically 
                         goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!

                                     FABRIZIO
                         You see? Is my destinio!! Like I 
                         told you. I go to l'America!! To be 
                         a millionaire!!
                              (to pubkeeper)
                         Capito?? I go to America!!

                                     PUBKEEPER
                         No, mate. Titanic go to America. In 
                         five minutes.

                                     JACK
                         Shit!! Come on, Fabri!
                              (grabbing their stuff)
                         Come on!!
                              (to all, grinning)
                         It's been grand.

               They run for the door.

                                     PUBKEEPER
                         'Course I'm sure if they knew it was 
                         you lot comin', they'd be pleased to 
                         wait!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TERMINAL - TITANIC

               Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world 
               in the kit bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. 
               They tear through milling crowds next to the terminal. Shouts 
               go up behind them as they jostle slow-moving gentlemen. They 
               dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of people. 
               They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead stop... 
               staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven 
               stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. 
               The Titanic is monstrous.

               Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward 
               the third class gangway aft, at E deck. They reach the bottom 
               of the ramp just as SIXTH OFFICER MOODY detaches it at the 
               top. It starts to swing down from the gangway doors.

                                     JACK
                         Wait!! We're passengers!

               Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets.

                                     MOODY
                         Have you been through the inspection 
                         queue?

                                     JACK
                              (lying cheerfully)
                         Of course! Anyway, we don't have 
                         lice, we're Americans.
                              (glances at Fabrizio)
                         Both of us.

                                     MOODY
                              (testy)
                         Right, come aboard.

               Moody has QUARTERMASTER ROWE reattach the gangway. Jack and 
               Fabrizio come aboard. Moody glances at the tickets, then 
               passes Jack and Fabrizio through to Rowe. Rowe looks at the 
               names on the tickets to enter them in the passenger list.

                                     ROWE
                         Gundersen. And...
                              (reading Fabrizio's)
                         Gundersen.

               He hands the tickets back, eyeing Fabrizio's Mediterranean 
               looks suspiciously.

                                     JACK
                              (grabbing Fabrizio's 
                              arm)
                         Come on, Sven.

               Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the 
               white-painted corridero... grinning from ear to ear.

                                     JACK
                         We are the luckiest sons of bitches 
                         in the world!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC AND DOCK - DAY

               The mooring lines, as big around as a man's arm, are dropped 
               into the water. A cheer goes up on the pier as SEVEN TUGS 
               pull the Titanic away from the quay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AFT WELL DECK / POOP DECK - DAY

               JACK AND FABRIZIO burst through a door onto the aft well 
               deck. TRACKING WITH THEM as they run across the deck and up 
               the steel stairs to the poop deck. They get to the rail and 
               Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on the dock.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         You know somebody?

                                     JACK
                         Of course not. That's not the point.
                              (to the crowd)
                         Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!

               Grinning, Fabrizio joins in, adding his voice to the swell 
               of voices, feeling the exhilaration of the moment.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         Goodbye! I will never forget you!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK - DAY

               The crowd of cheering well-wishers waves heartily as a black 
               wall of metal moves past them. Impossibly tiny figures wave 
               back from the ship's rails. Titanic gathers speed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RIVER TEST - DAY

               IN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind 
               the lead tug, which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before 
               the mighty plow of the liner's hull as it moves down the 
               River Test toward the English Channel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD CLASS BERTHING / G-DECK FORWARD - DAY

               Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors 
               lining both sides like a college dorm. Total confusion as 
               people argue over luggage in several languages, or wander in 
               confusion in the labyrinth. They pass emigrants studying the 
               signs over the doors, and looking up the words in phrase 
               books.

               They find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel 
               white, with four bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other 
               two guys are already there. OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN.

               Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes 
               the other.

                                     BJORN
                              (in Swedish; subtitled)
                         Where is Sven?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUITE B-52-56 - DAY

               By contrast, the so-called "Millionaire Suite" is in the 
               Empire style, and comprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe 
               room, and a large sitting room. In addition there is a private 
               50 foot promenade deck outside.

               A room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of 
               orange juice and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking 
               through her new paintings. There is a Monet of water lilies, 
               a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract works. They are all 
               unknown paintings... lost works.

               Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and 
               vines on trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in 
               the sitting room.

                                     CAL
                         Those mud puddles were certainly a 
                         waste of money.

                                     ROSE
                              (looking at a cubist 
                              portrait)
                         You're wrong. They're fascinating. 
                         Like in a dream... there's truth 
                         without logic. What's his name 
                         again...?
                              (reading off the canvas)
                         Picasso.

                                     CAL
                              (coming into the 
                              sitting room)
                         He'll never amount to a thing, trust 
                         me. At least they were cheap.

               A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into 
               the room on a handtruck.

                                     CAL
                         Put that in the wardrobe.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets it 
               on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in 
               there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes.

                                     TRUDY
                         It smells so brand new. Like they 
                         built it all just for us. I mean... 
                         just to think that tonight, when I 
                         crawl between the sheets, I'll be 
                         the first --

               Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom.

                                     CAL
                              (looking at Rose)
                         And when I crawl between the sheets 
                         tonight, I'll still be the first.

                                     TRUDY
                              (blushing at the 
                              innuendo)
                         S'cuse me, Miss.

               She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up 
               behind Rose and puts his hands on her shoulders. An act of 
               possession, not intimacy.

                                     CAL
                         The first and only. Forever.

               Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for 
               her, now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHERBOURG HARBOR, FRANCE - LATE DUSK

               Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. 
               She is lit up like a floating palace, and her thousand 
               portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters. The 150 foot 
               tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking like a rowboat. 
               The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS RECEPTION / D-DECK

               Entering the first class reception room from the tender are 
               a number of prominent passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN 
               in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway, carrying 
               a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter running to catch 
               up with her to take the bags.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, I wasn't about to wait all day 
                         for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of 
                         the way if you think you can manage.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         At Cherbourg a woman came aboard 
                         named Margaret Brown, but we all 
                         called her Molly. History would call 
                         her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her 
                         husband had struck gold someplace 
                         out west, and she was what mother 
                         called "new money".

               At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who 
               dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be 
               one of them.

                         By the next afternoon we had made 
                         our final stop and we were steaming 
                         west from the coast of Ireland, with 
                         nothing out ahead of us but ocean...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW - DAY

               The ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. 
               Jack and Fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving 
               railing so familiar from images of the wreck. Jack leans 
               over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the 
               surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. / EXT. TITANIC - SERIES OF SCENES - DAY

               ON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST 
               OFFICER WILLIAM MURDOCH.

                                     CAPTAIN SMITH
                         Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's 
                         stretch her legs.

               Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL.

               Now begins a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to 
               the great ship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with 
               a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of 
               the ship of dreams.

               IN THE ENGINE ROOM

               The telegraph clangs and moves to "All Ahead Full".

                                     CHIEF ENGINEER BELL
                         All ahead full!

               On the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches 
               carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust 
               valves. Towering above them are the twin RECIPROCATING 
               engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-long connecting 
               rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive 
               crankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of 
               marching giants.

               IN THE BOILER ROOMS

               The STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring 
               furnaces. The "black gang" are covered with sweat and coal 
               dust, their muscles working like part of the machinery as 
               they toil in the hellish glow.

               UNDERWATER

               The enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling 
               the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that 
               lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours 
               from the funnels as --

               The water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds 
               builds. THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind 
               streaming through his hair and --

               Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. 
               He stands with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the 
               storybook picture of a Captain... a great patriarch of the 
               sea.

                                     FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH
                         Twenty one knots, sir!

                                     SMITH
                         She's got a bone in her teeth now, 
                         eh, Mr. Murdoch.

               Smith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He 
               contentedly watches the white V of water hurled outward from 
               the bows like an expression of his own personal power. They 
               are invulnerable, towering over the sea.

               AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down.

               In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, 
               running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow. 
               They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion. Jack 
               watches the dolphins and grins. They breach, jumping clear 
               of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of 
               the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut.

               Fabrizio looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the 
               sunsparkles.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         I can see the Statue of Liberty 
                         already.
                              (grinning at Jack)
                         Very small... of course.

               THE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against 
               the sea.

               NOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we 
               continue back, and the ships rolls endlessly forward 
               underneath. Over the bridge wing, along the boat deck until 
               her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and march past like 
               the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until 
               we are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on 
               the decks and standing at the rail become antlike.

               And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in 
               a gorgeous aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty.

                         ...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. 
                         Andrews here, designed her from the

               seated with Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews

                         Well, I may have knocked her together, 
                         but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He 
                         envisioned a steamer so grand in 
                         scale, and so luxurious in its 
                         appointments, that its supremacy 
                         would never be challenged. And here 
                         she is...
                              (he slaps the table)
                         ...willed into solid reality.

                         Why're ships always bein' called 
                         "she"? Is it because men think half 
                         the women around have big sterns and 
                         should be weighed in tonnage?
                              (they all laugh)
                         Just another example of the men 
                         settin' the rules their way.

               The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette.

                                     RUTH
                         You know I don't like that, Rose.

                                     CAL
                         She knows.

               Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.

                                     CAL
                              (to the waiter)
                         We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with 
                         a little mint sauce.
                              (to Rose, after the 
                              waiter moves away)
                         You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?

               Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth.

                                     MOLLY
                         So, you gonna cut her meat for her 
                         too there, Cal?
                              (turning to Ismay)
                         Hey, who came up with the name 
                         Titanic? You, Bruce?

                                     ISMAY
                         Yes, actually. I wanted to convey 
                         sheer size. And size means stability, 
                         luxury... and safety --

                                     ROSE
                         Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas 
                         about the male preoccupation with 
                         size might be of particular interest 
                         to you, Mr. Ismay.

               Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.

                                     RUTH
                         My God, Rose, what's gotten into --

                                     ROSE
                         Excuse me.

               She stalks away.

                                     RUTH
                              (mortified)
                         I do apologize.

                                     MOLLY
                         She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you 
                         can handle her?

                                     CAL
                              (tense but feigning 
                              unconcern)
                         Well, I may have to start minding 
                         what she reads from now on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. POOP DECK / AFTER DECKS - DAY

               Jack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out 
               behind him to the horizon. He has his knees pulled up, 
               supporting a leather bound sketching pad, his only valuable 
               possession. With conte crayon he draws rapidly, using sure 
               strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL has his 
               3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the 
               rail. She is leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, 
               watching the seagulls.

               THE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of 
               the humanity of the moment. Jack is good. Really good. 
               Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder. He nods appreciatively.

               TOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a 
               crewmember comes by, walking three small dogs around the 
               deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCH BULLDOG, is among the 
               ugliest creatures on the planet.

                                     TOMMY
                         That's typical. First class dogs 
                         come down here to take a shit.

               Jack looks up from his sketch.

                                     JACK
                         That's so we know where we rank in 
                         the scheme of things.

                                     TOMMY
                         Like we could forget.

               Jack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B 
               deck promenade stands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white 
               gloves.

               CLOSE ON JACK

               Unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across from 
               each other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a 
               valley between them. She on her promontory, he on his much 
               lower one. She stares down at the water.

               He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She 
               looks at the frilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the 
               rail. It sails far down to the water and is carried away, 
               astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. He is riveted by 
               her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and 
               isolated.

               Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazing at 
               Rose. Fabrizio and Tommy grin at each other.

               Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught 
               staring, but he doesn't look away. She does, but then looks 
               back. Their eyes meet across the space of the well deck, 
               across the gulf between worlds.

               Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. 
               She jerks her arm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms 
               away, and he goes after her, disappearing along the A-deck 
               promenade. Jack stares after her.

                                     TOMMY
                         Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have 
                         angels fly out o' yer arse as get 
                         next to the likes o' her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON - NIGHT

               SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in 
               heated conversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, 
               while on the other side LADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth 
               animatedly. We don't hear what they are saying. Rose is 
               staring at her plate, barely listening to the inconsequential 
               babble around her.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         I saw my whole life as if I'd already 
                         lived it... an endless parade of 
                         parties and cotillions, yachts and 
                         polo matches... always the same narrow 
                         people, the same mindless chatter. I 
                         felt like I was standing at a great 
                         precipice, with no one to pull me 
                         back, no one who cared... or even 
                         noticed.

               ANGLE BENEATH TABLE

               Showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab salad. 
               She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and 
               harder until it draws blood.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR / B DECK - NIGHT

               Rose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other 
               way greets her, and she nods with a slight smile. She is 
               perfectly composed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her 
               reflection in the large vanity mirror. Just stands there, 
               then --

               With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping 
               off her pearl necklace, which explodes across the room. In a 
               frenzy she tears at herself, her clothes, her hair... then 
               attacks the room. She flings everything off the dresser and 
               it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a handmirror 
               against the vanity, cracking it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A DECK PROMENADE, AFT - NIGHT

               Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, 
               her hair flying. She is crying, her cheeks streaked with 
               tears. But also angry, furious! Shaking with emotions she 
               doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred, desperation. A 
               strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional 
               display in public.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT

               Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars 
               blazing gloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and 
               smoking a cigarette.

               Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from 
               the well deck. They are the only two on the stern deck, except 
               for QUARTERMASTER ROWE, twenty feet above them on the docking 
               bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack in the shadows, and 
               runs right past him.

               TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. 
               Her breath hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. 
               Rose slams against the base of the stern flagpole and clings 
               there, panting. She stares out at the black water.

               Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her 
               long dress way up, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically 
               she turns her body and gets her heels on the white-painted 
               gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out toward blackness. 
               60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning the 
               Atlantic into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward 
               the horizon.

               IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in 
               reverse. Below her are the huge letters of the name "TITANIC".

               She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down 
               hypnotized, into the vortex below her. Her dress and hair 
               are lifted by the wind of the ship's movement. The only sound, 
               above the rush of water below, is the flutter and snap of 
               the big Union Jack right above her.

                                     JACK
                         Don't do it.

               She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes 
               a second for her eyes to focus.

                                     ROSE
                         Stay back! Don't come any closer!

               Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow 
               from the stern running lights.

                                     JACK
                         Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.

                                     ROSE
                         No! Stay where you are. I mean it. 
                         I'll let go.

                                     JACK
                         No you won't.

                                     ROSE
                         What do you mean no I won't? Don't 
                         presume to tell me what I will and 
                         will not do. You don't know me.

                                     JACK
                         You would have done it already. Now 
                         come on, take my hand.

               Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through 
               the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing 
               her balance.

                                     ROSE
                         You're distracting me. Go away.

                                     JACK
                         I can't. I'm involved now. If you 
                         let go I have to jump in after you.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.

               He takes off his jacket.

                                     JACK
                         I'm a good swimmer.

               He starts unlacing his left shoe.

                                     ROSE
                         The fall alone would kill you.

                                     JACK
                         It would hurt. I'm not saying it 
                         wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot 
                         more concerned about the water being 
                         so cold.

               She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is 
               sinking in.

                                     ROSE
                         How cold?

                                     JACK
                              (taking off his left 
                              shoe)
                         Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees 
                         over.

               He starts unlacing his right shoe.

                                     JACK
                         Ever been to Wisconsin?

                                     ROSE
                              (perplexed)
                         No.

                                     JACK
                         Well they have some of the coldest 
                         winters around, and I grew up there, 
                         near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was 
                         a kid me and my father were ice-
                         fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-
                         fishing's where you chop a hole in 
                         the --

                                     ROSE
                         I know what ice fishing is!

                                     JACK
                         Sorry. Just... you look like kind of 
                         an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through 
                         some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, 
                         water that cold... like that right 
                         down there... it hits you like a 
                         thousand knives all over your body. 
                         You can't breath, you can't think... 
                         least not about anything but the 
                         pain.
                              (takes off his other 
                              shoe)
                         Which is why I'm not looking forward 
                         to jumping in after you. But like I 
                         said, I don't see a choice. I guess 
                         I'm kinda hoping you'll come back 
                         over the rail and get me off the 
                         hook here.

                                     ROSE
                         You're crazy.

                                     JACK
                         That's what everybody says. But with 
                         all due respect, I'm not the one 
                         hanging off the back of a ship.

               He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.

                                     JACK
                         Come on. You don't want to do this. 
                         Give me your hand.

               Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his 
               eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.

                                     ROSE
                         Alright.

               She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around 
               toward him. He reaches out to take it, firmly.

                                     JACK
                         I'm Jack Dawson.

                                     ROSE
                              (voice quavering)
                         Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.

               Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the 
               height is terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts 
               her footing, turning to face the ship. As she starts to climb, 
               her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge 
               of the deck.

               She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping 
               her hand, is jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a 
               lower rail with her free hand.

               QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream 
               and heads for the ladder.

                                     ROSE
                         HELP! HELP!!

                                     JACK
                         I've got you. I won't let go.

               Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself 
               on the railing with his other hand. Rose tries to get some 
               kind of foothold on the smooth hull. Jack tries to lift her 
               bodily over the railing. She can't get any footing in her 
               dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS 
               again.

               Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip 
               on as she flails, gets her over the railing. They fall 
               together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a 
               way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her.

               Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like 
               it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail.

                                     ROWE
                         Here, what's all this?!

               Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her 
               dishevelled and sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and 
               the hem is pushing up above her knees, showing one ripped 
               stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage man with his 
               jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, 
               and starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the 
               deck to join them.

                                     ROWE
                              (to Jack)
                         Here you, stand back! Don't move an 
                         inch!
                              (to the seamen)
                         Fetch the Master at Arms.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT

               A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly 
               MASTER AT ARMS, the closest thing to a cop on board. He is 
               handcuffing Jack. Cal is right in front of Jack, and furious. 
               He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another 
               man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening 
               dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a 
               mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He 
               offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench 
               nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more concerned with 
               Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.

                                     CAL
                         What made you think you could put 
                         your hands on my fiancee?! Look at 
                         me, you filth! What did you think 
                         you were doing?!

                                     ROSE
                         Cal, stop! It was an accident.

                                     CAL
                         An accident?!

                                     ROSE
                         It was... stupid really. I was leaning 
                         over and I slipped.

               Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.

                                     ROSE
                         I was leaning way over, to see the... 
                         ah... propellers. And I slipped and 
                         I would have gone overboard... and 
                         Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost 
                         went over himself.

                                     CAL
                         You wanted to see the propellers?

                                     GRACIE
                              (shaking his head)
                         Women and machinery do not mix.

                                     MASTER AT ARMS
                              (to Jack)
                         Was that the way of it?

               Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really 
               happened.

                                     JACK
                         Uh huh. That was pretty much it.

               He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret 
               together.

                                     COLONEL GRACIE
                         Well! The boy's a hero then. Good 
                         for you son, well done!
                              (to Cal)
                         So it's all's well and back to our 
                         brandy, eh?

               Jack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving.

                                     CAL
                              (rubbing her arms)
                         Let's get you in. You're freezing.

               Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.

                                     GRACIE
                              (low)
                         Ah... perhaps a little something for 
                         the boy?

                                     CAL
                         Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty 
                         should do it.

                                     ROSE
                         Is that the going rate for saving 
                         the woman you love?

                                     CAL
                         Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to 
                         do?

               Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... 
               a steerage ruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.

                                     CAL
                         I know.
                              (to Jack)
                         Perhaps you could join us for dinner 
                         tomorrow, to regale our group with 
                         your heroic tale?

                                     JACK
                              (looking straight at 
                              Rose)
                         Sure. Count me in.

                                     CAL
                         Good. Settled then.

               Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. He 
               leans close to Gracie as they walk away.

                                     CAL
                         This should be amusing.

                                     JACK
                              (as Lovejoy passes)
                         Can I bum a cigarette?

               Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket 
               and snaps it open. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, 
               popping it behind his ear for later. Lovejoy lights Jack's 
               cigarette.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         You'll want to tie those.
                              (Jack looks at his 
                              shoes)
                         Interesting that the young lady 
                         slipped so mighty all of a sudden 
                         and you still had time to take of 
                         your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?

               Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He 
               turns away to join his group.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her 
               doorway, reflected in the cracked mirror of her vanity. He 
               comes toward her.

                                     CAL
                              (unexpectedly tender)
                         I know you've been melancholy, and I 
                         don't pretend to know why.

               From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel 
               case. She takes it, numbly.

                                     CAL
                         I intended to save this till the 
                         engagement gals next week. But I 
                         thought tonight, perhaps a reminder 
                         of my feeling for you...

               Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... "HEART 
               OF THE OCEAN" in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent 
               blue stone glittering with an infinity of scalpel-like inner 
               reflections.

                                     ROSE
                         My God... Cal. Is it a --

                                     CAL
                         Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.

               He takes the necklace and during the following places it 
               around her throat. He turns her to the mirror, staring behind 
               her.

                                     CAL
                         It was once worn by Louis the 
                         Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de 
                         la Mer, the --

                                     ROSE
                         The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... 
                         it's overwhelming.

               He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror.

                                     CAL
                         It's for royalty. And we are royalty.

               His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to 
               be disarmed by Rose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, 
               for the first time, unguarded.

                                     CAL
                         There's nothing I couldn't give you. 
                         There's nothing I'd deny you if you 
                         would deny me. Open your heart to 
                         me, Rose.

               CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during 
               the following:

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         Of course his gift was only to reflect 
                         light back onto himself, to illuminate 
                         the greatness that was Caledon 
                         Hockley. It was a cold stone... a 
                         heart of ice.

               Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAME, we MORPH SLOWLY to her 
               eyes as the are now... transforming through 84 years of 
               life...

               TRANSITION

               INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK

               Without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has 
               appeared around her eyes. But the eyes themselves are the 
               same.

                                     OLD ROSE
                         After all these years, feel it closing 
                         around my throat like a dog collar.

               THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face.

                                     ROSE
                         I can still feel its weight. If you 
                         could have felt it, not just seen 
                         it...

                                     LOVETT
                         Well, that's the general idea, my 
                         dear.

                                     BODINE
                         So let me get this right. You were 
                         gonna kill yourself by jumping off 
                         the Titanic?
                              (he guffaws)
                         That's great!

                                     LOVETT
                              (warningly)
                         Lewis...

               But Rose laughs with Bodine.

                                     BODINE
                              (still laughing)
                         All you had to do was wait two days!

               Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. 
               Hours have passed. This process is taking too long.

                                     LOVETT
                         Rose, tell us more about the diamond. 
                         What did Hockley do with it after 
                         that?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, 
                         Mr. Lovett.

               Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.

                                     LOVETT
                         Wait! Can you give us something go 
                         on, here. Like who had access to the 
                         safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? 
                         The valet. Did he have the 
                         combination?

                                     LIZZY
                         That's enough.

               Lizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reappears at the doorway 
               in a frail wave goodbye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over 
               the water. Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the 
               partners' rep. They weave among deck cranes, launch crew, 
               sub maintenance guys.

                                     BUELL
                         The partners are pissed.

                         Bobby, buy me time. I need time.

                                     BUELL
                         We're running thirty thousand a day, 
                         and we're six days over. I'm telling 
                         you what they're telling me. The 
                         hand is on the plug. It's starting 
                         to pull.

                                     BROCK
                         Well you tell the hand I need another 
                         two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... 
                         we're close! I smell it. I smell 
                         ice. She had the diamond on... now 
                         we just have to find out where it 
                         wound up. I just gotta work her a 
                         bit more. Okay?

               Brock turns and sees Lizzy standing behind him. She has 
               overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes 
               to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot 
               on the deck.

                                     BROCK
                         Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you 
                         for a second.

                                     LIZZY
                         Don't you mean work me?

                                     BROCK
                         Look, I'm running out of time. I 
                         need your help.

                                     LIZZY
                         I'm not going to help you browbeat 
                         my hundred and one year old 
                         grandmother. I came down here to 
                         tell you to back off.

                                     BROCK
                              (with undisguised 
                              desperation)
                         Lizzy... you gotta understand 
                         something. I've bet it all to find 
                         the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all 
                         my dough tied up in this thing. My 
                         wife even divorced me over this hunt. 
                         I need what's locked inside your 
                         grandma's memory.
                              (he holds out his 
                              hand)
                         You see this? Right here?

               She looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around 
               an imaginary shape.

                                     LIZZY
                         What?

                                     BROCK
                         That's the shape my hand's gonna be 
                         when I hold that thing. You 
                         understand? I'm not leaving here 
                         without it.

                                     LIZZY
                         Look, Brock, she's going to do this 
                         her way, in her own time. Don't 
                         forget, she contacted you. She's out 
                         here for her own reasons, God knows 
                         what they are.

                                     LOVETT
                         Maybe she wants to make peace with 
                         the past.

                                     LIZZY
                         What past? She has never once, not 
                         once, ever said a word about being 
                         on the Titanic until two days ago.

                                     LOVETT
                         Then we're all meeting your 
                         grandmother for the first time.

                                     LIZZY
                              (looks at him hard)
                         You think she was really there?

                                     LOVETT
                         Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She 
                         was there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. IMAGING SHACK

               Bodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen 
               seeing THE LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK -- SNOOP DOG is moving 
               along the starboard side of the hull, heading aft. The 
               rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march past on the 
               right.

                                     ROSE
                         The next day, Saturday, I remember 
                         thinking how the sunlight felt.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. B DECK TITANIC - DAY

               MATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new 
               Titanic in 1912, passing the end of the enclosed promenade 
               just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in front of us. 
               She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.

               IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go 
               down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop 
               what they're doing and stare at her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

               The social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison 
               to the opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous 
               place. There are mothers with babies, kids running between 
               the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded 
               in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing 
               chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There 
               is even an upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around 
               it.

               Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around 
               chasing a rat under the benches, trying to whomp it with a 
               shoe and causing general havoc. Jack is playing with 5 year 
               old CORA CARTMELL, drawing funny faces together in his 
               sketchbook.

               Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an 
               attractive Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family 
               at a table across the room.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         No Italian? Some little English?

                                     HELGA
                         No, no. Norwegian. Only.

               Helga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a 
               take... and Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see...

               Rose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... 
               a hush falls. Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the 
               steerage passengers stare openly at this princess, some with 
               resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and gives a little 
               smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her, smiling.

                                     ROSE
                         Hello Jack.

               Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting 
               Cinderella.

                                     JACK
                         Hello again.

                                     ROSE
                         Could I speak to you in private?

                                     JACK
                         Uh, yes. Of course. After you.

               He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his 
               shoulder, one eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving 
               a stunned silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY

               Jack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading 
               and talking in steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously 
               at the mismatched couple. He feels out of place in his rough 
               clothes. They are both awkward, for different reasons.

                                     JACK
                         So, you got a name by the way?

                                     ROSE
                         Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.

                                     JACK
                         That's quite a moniker. I may hafta 
                         get you to write that down.

               There is an awkward pause.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Dawson, I --

                                     JACK
                         Jack.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack... I feel like such an idiot. 
                         It took me all morning to get up the 
                         nerve to face you.

                                     JACK
                         Well, here you are.

                                     ROSE
                         Here I am. I... I want to thank you 
                         for what you did. Not just for... 
                         for pulling me back. But for your 
                         discretion.

                                     JACK
                         You're welcome. Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         Look, I know what you must be 
                         thinking! Poor little rich girl. 
                         What does she know about misery?

                                     JACK
                         That's not what I was thinking. What 
                         I was thinking was... what could 
                         have happened to hurt this girl so 
                         much she though she had no way out.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't... it wasn't just one thing. 
                         It was everything. It was them, it 
                         was their whole world. And I was 
                         trapped in it, like an insect in 
                         amber.
                              (in a rush)
                         I just had to get away... just run 
                         and run and run... and then I was at 
                         the back rail and there was no more 
                         ship... even the Titanic wasn't big 
                         enough. Not enough to get away from 
                         them. And before I'd really though 
                         about it, I was over the rail. I was 
                         so furious. I'll show them. They'll 
                         be sorry!

                                     JACK
                         Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course 
                         you'll be dead.

                                     ROSE
                              (she lowers her head)
                         Oh God, I am such an utter fool.

                                     JACK
                         That penguin last night, is he one 
                         of them?

                                     ROSE
                         Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.

                                     JACK
                         Is he your boyfriend?

                                     ROSE
                         Worse I'm afraid.

               She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.

                                     JACK
                         Gawd look at that thing! You would 
                         have gone straight to the bottom.

               They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who 
               is clearly not a first class passenger, but Rose just glares 
               at him away.

                                     JACK
                         So you feel like you're stuck on a 
                         train you can't get off 'cause you're 
                         marryin' this fella.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, exactly!

                                     JACK
                         So don't marry him.

                                     ROSE
                         If only it were that simple.

                                     JACK
                         It is that simple.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, Jack... please don't judge me 
                         until you've seen my world.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I guess I will tonight.

               Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates 
               his sketchbook.

                                     ROSE
                         What's this?

                                     JACK
                         Just some sketches.

                                     ROSE
                         May I?

               The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed 
               the book. She sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. 

               ON JACK'S sketches... each one an expressive little bit of 
               humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping man, a father and 
               daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive. His 
               book is a celebration of the human condition.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack, these are quite good! Really, 
                         they are.

                                     JACK
                         Well, they didn't think too much of 
                         'em in Paree.

               Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack 
               scrambles after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, 
               over the rail.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!

                                     JACK
                         Well, they didn't think too much of 
                         'em in Paree.

               He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish.

                                     JACK
                         I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, 
                         they're not worth a damn anyway.

               For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail 
               off.

                                     ROSE
                              (laughing)
                         You're deranged!

               She goes back to the book, turning a page.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, well...

               She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by 
               the languid beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, 
               real, with expressive hands and eyes. They feel more like 
               portraits than studies of the human form... almost 
               uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as 
               some strollers go by.

                                     ROSE
                              (trying to be very 
                              adult)
                         And these were drawn from life?

                                     JACK
                         Yup. That's one of the great things 
                         about Paris. Lots of girls willing 
                         take their clothes off.

               She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half 
               in sunlight, half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one 
               furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful. The 
               drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia O'Keefe.

                                     ROSE
                         You liked this woman. You used her 
                         several times.

                                     JACK
                         She had beautiful hands.

                                     ROSE
                              (smiling)
                         I think you must have had a love 
                         affair with her...

                                     JACK
                              (laughing)
                         No, no! Just with her hands.

                                     ROSE
                              (looking up from the 
                              drawings)
                         You have a gift, Jack. You do. You 
                         see people.

                                     JACK
                         I see you.

               There it is. That piercing gaze again.

                                     ROSE
                         And...?

                                     JACK
                         You wouldn'ta jumped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECEPTION ROOM / D-DECK - DAY

               Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDS, the 
               COUNTESS OF ROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician 
               features. Ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers 
               her voice.

                                     RUTH
                         Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is 
                         coming this way. Get up, quickly 
                         before she sits with us.

               Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are 
               rising.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch 
                         you at tea.

                                     RUTH
                         We're awfully sorry you missed it. 
                         The Countess and I are just off to 
                         take the air on the boat deck.

                                     MOLLY
                         That sounds great. Let's go. I need 
                         to catch up on the gossip.

               Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand 
               Staircase to go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the 
               room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at 
               another table.

                                     ISMAY
                         So you've not lit the last four 
                         boilers then?

                                     SMITH
                         No, but we're making excellent time.

                                     ISMAY
                              (impatiently)
                         Captain, the press knows the size of 
                         Titanic, let them marvel at her speed 
                         too. We must give them something new 
                         to print. And the maiden voyage of 
                         Titanic must make headlines!

                                     SMITH
                         I prefer not to push the engines 
                         until they've been properly run in.

                                     ISMAY
                         Of course I leave it to your good 
                         offices to decide what's best, but 
                         what a glorious end to your last 
                         crossing if we get into New York 
                         Tuesday night and surprise them all.
                              (Ismay slaps his hand 
                              on the table)
                         Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

               A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A DECK PROMENADE - DAY

               Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs 
               in the slanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to 
               serve tea or hot cocoa.

                                     ROSE
                              (girlish and excited)
                         You know, my dream has always been 
                         to just chuck it all and become an 
                         artist... living in a garret, poor 
                         but free!

                                     JACK
                              (laughing)
                         You wouldn't last two days. There's 
                         no hot water, and hardly ever any 
                         caviar.

                                     ROSE
                              (angry in a flash)
                         Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And 
                         I'm tired of people dismissing my 
                         dreams with a chuckle and a pat on 
                         the head.

                                     JACK
                         I'm sorry. Really... I am.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, alright. There's something in 
                         me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know 
                         what it is, whether I should be an 
                         artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. 
                         Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan 
                         spirit...

               She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. 
               Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up.

                                     ROSE
                         ...or a moving picture actress!

               She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward --

               DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden 
               movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've 
                         left your lover on the shore. You 
                         may never see him agian. Try to be 
                         sadder, darling.

               SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical 
               pose at the rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. 
               Rose pulls Jack into the picture and makes him pose.

               Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this 
               in CUTS, with music and no dialogue.

               SERIES OF CUTS:

               Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to 
               her forehead.

               Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls 
               pantomiming fanning him like slave girls.

               Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while 
               Rose, standing, turns her head in bored disdain.

               Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western 
               shoot-out. Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an 
               air mustache like Snidely Whiplash.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET

               Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck 
               rail aft, shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on.

               It is a magical moment... perfect.

                                     ROSE
                         So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?

                                     JACK
                         Well, then logging got to be too 
                         much like work, so I went down to 
                         Los Angeles to the pier in Santa 
                         Monica. That's a swell place, they 
                         even have a rollercoaster. I sketched 
                         portraits there for ten cents a piece.

                                     ROSE
                         A whole ten cents?!

                                     JACK
                              (not getting it)
                         Yeah; it was great money... I could 
                         make a dollar a day, sometimes. But 
                         only in summer. When it got cold, I 
                         decided to go to Paris and see what 
                         the real artists were doing.

                                     ROSE
                              (looks at the dusk 
                              sky)
                         Why can't I be like you Jack? Just 
                         head out for the horizon whenever I 
                         feel like it.
                              (turning to him)
                         Say we'll go there, sometime... to 
                         that pier... even if we only ever 
                         just talk about it.

                                     JACK
                         Alright, we're going. We'll drink 
                         cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster 
                         until we throw up and we'll ride 
                         horses on the beach... right in the 
                         surf... but you have to ride like a 
                         cowboy, none of that side-saddle 
                         stuff.

                                     ROSE
                         You mean one leg on each side? 
                         Scandalous! Can you show me?

                                     JACK
                         Sure. If you like.

                                     ROSE
                              (smiling at him)
                         I think I would.
                              (she looks at the 
                              horizon)
                         And teach me to spit too. Like a 
                         man. Why should only men be able to 
                         spit. It's unfair.

                                     JACK
                         They didn't teach you that in 
                         finishing school? Here, it's easy. 
                         Watch closely.

               He spits. It arcs out over the water.

                                     JACK
                         Your turn.

               Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of 
               foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling 
               off into the water.

                                     JACK
                         Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like 
                         this... you hawk it down... 
                         HHHNNNK!... then roll it on your 
                         tongue, up to the front, like thith, 
                         then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You 
                         see the range on that thing?

               She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches 
               her through it (ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She 
               lets fly. So does he. Two comets of gob fly out over the 
               water.

                                     JACK
                         That was great!

               Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. 
               He sees her expression and turns.

               Ruth, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been 
               watching them hawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.

                                     ROSE
                         Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.

                                     RUTH
                         Charmed, I'm sure.

               Jack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't 
               know it. Molly Brown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the 
               introductions, we hear...

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         The others were gracious and curious 
                         about the man who'd saved my life. 
                         But my mother looked at him like an 
                         insect. A dangerous insect which 
                         must be squashed quickly.

                                     MOLLY
                         Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a 
                         good man to have around in a sticky 
                         spot --

               They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind 
               them.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why do they insist on always 
                         announcing dinner like a damn cavalry 
                         charge?

                                     ROSE
                         Shall we go dress, mother?
                              (over her shoulder)
                         See you at dinner, Jack.

                                     RUTH
                              (as they walk away)
                         Rose, look at you... out in the sun 
                         with no hat. Honestly!

               The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly 
               alone on deck.

                                     MOLLY
                         Son, do you have the slightest 
                         comprehension of what you're doing?

                                     JACK
                         Not really.

                                     MOLLY
                         Well, you're about to go into the 
                         snakepit. I hope you're ready. What 
                         are you planning to wear?

               Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't 
               thought about that.

                                     MOLLY
                         I figured.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MOLLY BROWN'S STATEROOM

               Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over 
               the place. Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, 
               except for his jacket, and Molly is tying his bow tie.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't feel bad about it. My husband 
                         still can't tie one of these damn 
                         things after 20 years. There you go.

               She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack 
               goes into the bathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up 
               the stuff off the bed.

                                     MOLLY
                         I gotta buy everything in three sizes 
                         'cause I never know how much he's 
                         been eating while I'm away.

               She turns and sees him, though we don't.

                                     MOLLY
                         My, my, my... you shine up like a 
                         new penny.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / FIRST CLASS ENTRANCE - DUSK

               A purple sky, shot with orange, in the west. Drifting strains 
               of classic music. We TRACK WITH JACK along the deck. By 
               Edwardian standards he looks badass. Dashing in his borrowed 
               white-tie outfit, right down to his pearl studs.

               A steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class 
               Entrance.

                                     STEWARD
                         Good evening, sir.

               Jack plays the role smoothly. Nods with just the right degree 
               of disdain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. UPPER LANDING / GRAND STAIRCASE AND A-DECK

               Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor 
               spread out before him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, 
               with a crystal chandelier at its center. Sweeping down six 
               stories is the First Class Grand Staircase, the epitome of 
               the opulent naval architecture of the time.

               And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, 
               elaborate hairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen 
               in evening dress, standing with one hand at the small of the 
               back, talking quietly.

               Jack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory 
               greeting. He nods back, keeping it simple. He feels like a 
               spy.

               Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in 
               jewelry. They both walk right past Jack, neither one 
               recognizing him. Cal nods at him, one gent to another. But 
               Jack barely has time to be amused. Because just behind Cal 
               and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, 
               her low-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her 
               arms sheathed in white gloves that come well above above the 
               elbow. Jack is hypnotized by her beauty.

               CLOSE ON ROSE

               As she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance, 
               hand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he 
               takes it, kissing the back of her fingers. Rose flushes, 
               beaming noticeably. She can't take her eyes off him.

                                     JACK
                         I saw that in a nickelodeon once, 
                         and I always wanted to do it.

                                     ROSE
                         Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

                                     CAL
                              (caught off guard)
                         Dawson! I didn't recognize you.
                              (studies him)
                         Amazing! You could almost pass for a 
                         gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM

               CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D-DECK, as the party descends 
               to dinner. They encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a 
               beaded dress, in her own busty broad-shouldered way. Molly 
               grins when she sees Jack. As they are going into the dining 
               saloon she walks next to him, speaking low:

                                     MOLLY
                         Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer 
                         and keep your nose up.

                                     MOLLY
                         Remember, the only thing they respect 
                         is money, so just act like you've 
                         got a lot of it and you're in the 
                         club.

               As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, 
               pointing out several notables.

                                     ROSE
                         There's the Countess Rothes. And 
                         that's John Jacob Astor... the richest 
                         man on the ship. His little wifey 
                         there, Madeleine, is my age and in a 
                         delicate condition. See how she's 
                         trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.
                              (nodding toward a 
                              couple)
                         And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and 
                         Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs 
                         naughty lingerie, among her many 
                         talents. Very popular with the royals.

               Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-
               Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and 
               Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show 
               him another couple, dressed impeccably.

                                     ROSE
                         And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and 
                         his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. 
                         Guggenheim is at home with the 
                         children, of course.

               Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male 
               counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse.

                                     SIR COSMO
                         Hockley, she is splendid.

                                     CAL
                         Thank you.

                                     GRACIE
                         Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, 
                         and it can only be luck.

               Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, 
               somewhat coquettishly.

                                     RUTH
                         How can you say that Colonel? Caledon 
                         Hockley is a great catch.

               The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they 
               run into the Astor's going through the ornate double doors.

                                     ROSE
                         J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to 
                         meet Jack Dawson.

                                     ASTOR
                              (shaking his hand)
                         Good to meet you Jack. Are you of 
                         the Boston Dawsons?

                                     JACK
                         No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, 
                         actually.

               J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. 
               Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to 
               Rose:

                                     MADELEINE
                         It's a pity we're both spoken for, 
                         isn't it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DINING SALOON

               Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a 
               constellation of chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people 
               and beautiful music from BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small 
               orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and move across the room 
               to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear...

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         He must have been nervous but he 
                         never faltered. They assumed he was 
                         one of them... a young captain of 
                         industry perhaps... new money, 
                         obviously, but still a member of the 
                         club. Mother of course, could always 
                         be counted upon...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DINING SALOON - CLOSE ON RUTH

                                     RUTH
                         Tell us of the accommodations in 
                         steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're 
                         quite good on this ship.

               WIDER: THE TABLE

               Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and Thomas 
               Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel 
               Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the 
               Astors.

                                     JACK
                         The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any 
                         rats.

               Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off 
               his plate.

                                     CAL
                         Mr. Dawson is joining us from third 
                         class. He was of some assistance to 
                         my fiancee last night.
                              (to Jack, as if to a 
                              child)
                         This is foie gras. It's goose liver.

               We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomes the subject of furtive 
               glances. Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and 
               dangerous.

                                     GUGGENHEIM
                              (low to Madame Aubert)
                         What is Hockley hoping to prove, 
                         bringing this... bohemian... up here?

                                     WAITER
                              (to Jack)
                         How do you take your caviar, sir?

                                     CAL
                              (answering for him)
                         Just a soupcon of lemon...
                              (to Jack, smiling)
                         ...it improves the flavor with 
                         champagne.

                                     JACK
                              (to the waiter)
                         No caviar for me, thanks.
                              (to Cal)
                         Never did like it much.

               He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.

                                     RUTH
                         And where exactly do you live, Mr. 
                         Dawson?

                                     JACK
                         Well, right now my address is the 
                         RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's 
                         good humor.

               Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives 
               him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with 
               her eyes. He changes forks.

                                     RUTH
                         You find that sort of rootless 
                         existence appealing, do you?

                                     JACK
                         Well... it's a big world, and I want 
                         to see it all before I go. My father 
                         was always talkin' about goin' to 
                         see the ocean. He died in the town 
                         he was born in, and never did see 
                         it. You can't wait around, because 
                         you never know what hand you're going 
                         to get dealt next. See, my folks 
                         died in a fire when I was fifteen, 
                         and I've been on the road since. 
                         Somethin' like that teaches you to 
                         take life as it comes at you. To 
                         make each day count.

               Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute.

                                     MOLLY
                         Well said, Jack.

                                     COLONEL GRACIE
                              (raising his glass)
                         Here, here.

               Rose raises her glass, looking at Jack.

                                     ROSE
                         To making it count.

               Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him 
               further.

                                     RUTH
                         How is it you have the means to 
                         travel, Mr. Dawson?

                                     JACK
                         I work my way from place to place. 
                         Tramp steamers and such. I won my 
                         ticket on Titanic here in a lucky 
                         hand at poker.
                              (he glances at Rose)
                         A very lucky hand.

                                     GRACIE
                         All life is a game of luck.

                                     CAL
                         A real man makes his own luck, Archie.

               Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is 
               writing in his notebook, completely ignoring the conversation.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I 
                         see you everywhere writing in this 
                         little book.
                              (grabs it and reads)
                         Increase number of screws in hat 
                         hooks from 2 to 3. You build the 
                         biggest ship in the world and this 
                         preoccupies you?!

               Andrews smiles sheepishly.

                                     ISMAY
                         He knows every rivet in her, don't 
                         you Thomas?

                                     ANDREWS
                         All three million of them.

                                     ISMAY
                         His blood and soul are in the ship. 
                         She may be mine on paper, but in the 
                         eyes of God she belongs to Thomas 
                         Andrews.

                                     ROSE
                         Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. 
                         Truly.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Thank you, Rose.

               We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.

               TIME TRANSITION

               Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with cigars in 
               a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and 
               lighting.

                                     ROSE
                              (low, to Jack)
                         Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking 
                         Room.

                                     GRACIE
                              (rising)
                         Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?

                                     ROSE
                              (low)
                         Now they retreat into a cloud of 
                         smoke and congratulate each other on 
                         being masters of the universe.

                                     GRACIE
                         Joining us, Dawson? You don't want 
                         to stay out here with the women, do 
                         you?

               Actually he does, but...

                                     JACK
                         No thanks. I'm heading back.

                                     CAL
                         Probably best. It'll be all business 
                         and politics, that sort of thing. 
                         Wouldn't interest you. Good of you 
                         to come.

               Cal and the other gentlemen exit.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack, must you go?

                                     JACK
                         Time for my coach to turn back into 
                         a pumpkin.

               He leans over to take her hand.

               We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.

               Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous 
               room. Rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level. 
               It reads: "Make it count. Meet me at the clock".

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A-DECK FOYER - NIGHT

               Rose crosses the A-Deck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing 
               above. Overhead is the crystal dome. Jack has his back to 
               her, studying the ornate clock with its carved figures of 
               Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.

               MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward 
               him. He turns, sees her... smiles.

                                     JACK
                         Want to go to a real party?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

               Crowded and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying 
               on. An ad hoc band is gathered near the upright piano, honking 
               out lively stomping music on fiddle, accordion and tambourine. 
               People of all ages are dancing, drinking beer and wine, 
               smoking, laughing, even brawling.

               Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack 
               meanwhile dances with 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, 
               with her standing on his feet. As the tune ends, Rose leans 
               down to the little girl.

                                     ROSE
                         May I cut in, miss?

                                     JACK
                         You're still my best girl, Cora.

               Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is 
               trembling as he takes her right hand in his left. His other 
               hand slides to the small of her back. It is an electrifying 
               moment.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't know the steps.

                                     JACK
                         Just move with me. Don't think.

               The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, 
               she starts to get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts 
               to get the rhythm of the steps.

                                     ROSE
                         Wait... stop!

               She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings 
               them to Tommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into 
               the fray, dancing faster as the music speeds up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

               The scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over 
               as a drunk crashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose 
               dancing with Jack in her stocking feet. The steps are fast 
               and she shines with sweat. A space opens around them, and 
               people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and 
               faster.

               FABRIZIO AND HELGA

               Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. He whirls 
               her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go 
               wide when he realizes she's stronger than he is.

               The tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with 
               a flourish, allowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and 
               slightly tipsy, she does a graceful ballet ployer, feet turned 
               out perfectly. Everyone laughs and applauds. Rose is a hit 
               with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady party with 
               them.

               They move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs 
               Fabrizio's cigarette and takes a big drag. She's feeling 
               cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holding hands with Helga.

                                     JACK
                         How you two doin'?

                                     FABRIZIO
                         I don't know what she's say, she 
                         don't know what I say, so we get 
                         along fine.

               Tommy walks up with a pint for each of them. Rose chugs hers, 
               showing off.

                                     ROSE
                         You think a first class girl can't 
                         drink?

               Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes 
               into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She 
               laughs, not caring. But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and 
               wheeling him around.

                                     TOMMY
                         You stupid bastard!!

               Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps 
               into the middle of it, pushing them apart.

                                     JACK
                         Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the 
                         one about the Swede and the Irishman 
                         goin' to the whorehouse?

               Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. 
               Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder.

                                     ROSE
                         So, you think you're big tough men? 
                         Let's see you do this.

               In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, 
               and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips 
               of her toes. The guys gape at her incredible muscle control. 
               She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain. She 
               grabs one foot, hopping around.

                                     ROSE
                         Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.

               Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks 
               up.

               The DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy 
               watches through the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of 
               them laughing.

               Lovejoy closes the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT

               The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see 
               the Milky Way. Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. 
               Still giddy from the party, they are singing a popular song 
               "Come Josephine in My Flying Machine".

                                     JACK / ROSE
                         Come Josephine in my flying machine 
                         And it's up she goes! Up she goes! 
                         In the air she goes. Where? There 
                         she goes!

               They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have 
               reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, 
               not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound 
               of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and 
               leans back, staring at the cosmos.

                                     ROSE
                         Isn't it magnificent? So grand and 
                         endless.

               She goes to the rail and leans on it.

                                     ROSE
                         They're such small people, Jack... 
                         my crowd. They think they're giants 
                         on the earth, but they're not even 
                         dust in God's eye. They live inside 
                         this little tiny champagne bubble... 
                         and someday the bubble's going to 
                         burst.

               He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching 
               hers. It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either 
               one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their 
               hands are touching.

                                     JACK
                         You're not one of them. There's been 
                         a mistake.

                                     ROSE
                         A mistake?

                                     JACK
                         Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong 
                         address.

                                     ROSE
                              (laughing)
                         I did, didn't I?
                              (pointing suddenly)
                         Look! A shooting star.

                                     JACK
                         That was a long one. My father used 
                         to say that whenever you saw one, it 
                         was a soul going to heaven.

                                     ROSE
                         I like that. Aren't we supposed to 
                         wish on it?

               Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very 
               close together. It would be so easy to move another couple 
               of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems to be thinking the same 
               thing.

                                     JACK
                         What would you wish for?

               After a beat, Rose pulls back.

                                     ROSE
                         Something I can't have.
                              (she smiles sadly)
                         Goodnight, Jack. And thank you.

               She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class 
               Entrance.

                                     JACK
                         Rose!!

               But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE - DAY

               SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing 
               across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in 
               silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's 
               uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside.

                                     CAL
                         I had hoped you would come to me 
                         last night.

                                     ROSE
                         I was tired.

                                     CAL
                         Yes. Your exertions below decks were 
                         no doubt exausting.

                                     ROSE
                              (stiffening)
                         I see you had that undertaker of a 
                         manservant follow me.

                                     CAL
                         You will never behave like that again! 
                         Do you understand?

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not some foreman in your mills 
                         than you can command! I am your 
                         fiancee --

               Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table 
               with a crash. He moves to her in one shocking moment, 
               glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so 
               she is trapped between his arms.

                                     CAL
                         Yes! You are! And my wife... in 
                         practice, if not yet by law. So you 
                         will honor me, as a wife is required 
                         to honor her husband! I will not be 
                         made out a fool! Is this in any way 
                         unclear?

               Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, part 
               way through the door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows 
               Rose's glance and straightens up. He stalks past the maid, 
               entering the stateroom.

                                     ROSE
                         We... had a little accident. I'm 
                         sorry, Trudy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RUTH'S SUITE - DAY

               Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping 
               Ruth with her corset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's 
               fury at all.

                                     RUTH
                         You are not to see that boy again, 
                         do you understand me Rose? I forbid 
                         it!

               Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is 
               pulling the corset strings with both hands.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give 
                         yourself a nosebleed.

               Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking 
               it. CLACK!

                                     RUTH
                              (wheeling on her)
                         Rose, this is not a game! Our 
                         situation is precarious. You know 
                         the money's gone!

                                     ROSE
                         Of course I know it's gone. You remind 
                         me every day!

                                     RUTH
                         Your father left us nothing but a 
                         legacy of bad debts hidden by a good 
                         name. And that name is the only card 
                         we have to play.

               Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. 
               Ruth sucks in her waist and Rose pulls.

                                     RUTH
                         I don't understand you. It is a fine 
                         match with Hockley, and it will insure 
                         our survival.

                                     ROSE
                              (hurt and lost)
                         How can you put this on my shoulders?

               Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees -- the naked 
               fear in her mother's eyes.

                                     RUTH
                         Do you want to se me working as a 
                         seamstress? Is that what you want? 
                         Do you want to see our fine things 
                         sold at an auction, our memories 
                         scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, 
                         how can you be so selfish?

                                     ROSE
                         It's so unfair.

                                     RUTH
                         Of course it's unfair! We're women. 
                         Our choices are never easy.

               Rose pulls the corset tighter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON

               At the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in 
               the hymn "Almighty Father Strong To Save." Rose and Ruth 
               sing in the middle of the group.

               Lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose. He notices 
               a commotion at the entry doors. Jack has been halted there 
               by two stewards. He is dressed in his third class clothes, 
               and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of place.

                                     STEWARD
                         Look, you, you're not supposed to be 
                         in here.

                                     JACK
                         I was just here last night... don't 
                         you remember?
                              (seeing Lovejoy coming 
                              toward him)
                         He'll tell you.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater 
                         continue to be most appreciative of 
                         your assistance. They asked me to 
                         give you this in gratitude --

               He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to 
               take.

                                     JACK
                         I don't want money, I --

                                     LOVEJOY
                         ...and also to remind you that you 
                         hold a third class ticket and your 
                         presence here is no longer 
                         appropriate.

               Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him.

                                     JACK
                         I just need to talk to Rose for a --

                                     LOVEJOY
                         Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson 
                         gets back where he belongs.
                              (giving the twenties 
                              to the stewards)
                         And that he stays there.

                                     STEWARD
                         Yes sir!
                              (to Jack)
                         Come along you.

               END ON ROSE

               Not seeing Jack hustled out.

                                     ROSE
                              (singing)
                         O hear us when we cry to thee for 
                         those in peril on the sea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               An Edwardian nautilus room. There are machines we recognize, 
               and some don't. A woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a 
               long dress, looking ridiculous. Thomas Andrews is leading a 
               small tour group, including Rose, Ruth and Cal. Cal is working 
               the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained 
               stroke.

                                     CAL
                         Reminds me of my Harvard days.

               T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in 
               white flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like 
               his present-day counterpart on an "Abflex" infomercial. He 
               hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to 
               undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious.

                                     MCCAULEY
                         The electric horse is very popular. 
                         We even have an electric camel.
                              (to Ruth)
                         Care to try your hand at the rowing, 
                         m'am?

                                     RUTH
                         Don't be absurd. I can't think of a 
                         skill I should likely need less.

                                     ANDREWS
                         The next stop on our tour will be 
                         bridge. This way, please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AFT WELL DECK, B-DECK AND A-DECK - DAY

               Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by 
               Tommy and Fabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to B-Deck 
               and steps over the gate separating 3rd from 2nd class.

                                     TOMMY
                         She's a goddess amongst mortal men, 
                         there's no denyin'. But she's in 
                         another world, Jackie, forget her. 
                         She's closed the door.

               Jack moves furtively to the wall below the A-Deck promenade, 
               aft.

                                     JACK
                         It was them, not her.
                              (glancing around the 
                              deck)
                         Ready... go.

               Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, 
               crouching down. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted 
               up to the next deck, where he scrambles nimbly over the 
               railing, onto the First Class deck.

                                     TOMMY
                         He's not bein' logical, I tell ya.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         Amore is'a not logical.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A-DECK / AFT - DAY

               A man is playing with his son, who is spinning a top with a 
               string. The man's overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck 
               chair nearby. Jack emerges from behind one of the huge deck 
               cranes and calmly picks up the coat and bowler hat. He walks 
               away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair back with 
               spit. Then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance 
               he could pass for a gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM - DAY

               HAROLD BRIDE, the 21 year old Junior Wireless Operator, 
               hustles in and skirts around Andrews' tour group to hand a 
               Marconigram to Captain Smith.

                                     BRIDE
                         Another ice warning, sir. This one 
                         from the "Baltic".

                                     SMITH
                         Thank you, Sparks.

               Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in 
               his pocket. He nods reassuringly to Rose and the group.

                                     SMITH
                         Not to worry, it's quite normal for 
                         this time of year. In fact, we're 
                         speeding up. I've just ordered the 
                         last boilers lit.

               Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward 
               the door. They exit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT 
               LIGHTOLLER comes out of the chartroom, stopping next to First 
               Officer Murdoch.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Did we ever find those binoculars 
                         for the lookouts?

                                     FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH
                         Haven't seen them since Southampton.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE - DAY

               Andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat 
               deck.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my 
                         head, and with the number of lifeboats 
                         times the capacity you mentioned... 
                         forgive me, but it seems that there 
                         are not enough for everyone aboard.

                                     ANDREWS
                         About half, actually. Rose, you miss 
                         nothing, do you? In fact, I put in 
                         these new type davits, which can 
                         take an extra row of boats here.
                              (he gestures along 
                              the deck)
                         But it was thought... by some... 
                         that the deck would look too 
                         cluttered. So I was over-ruled.

                                     CAL
                              (slapping the side of 
                              a boat)
                         Waste of deck space as it is, on an 
                         unsinkable ship!

                                     ANDREWS
                         Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have 
                         built you a good ship, strong and 
                         true. She's all the lifeboat you 
                         need.

               As they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail 
               and walks up behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on 
               the arm and she turns, gasping. He motions and she cuts away 
               from the group toward a door which Jack holds open. They 
               duck into the --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               Jack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the 
               ripple-glass window to the starboard rail, where the gym 
               instructor is chatting up the woman who was riding the bike. 
               Rose and Jack are alone in the room.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack, this is impossible. I can't 
                         see you.

               He takes her by the shoulders.

                                     JACK
                         Rose, you're no picnic... you're a 
                         spoiled little brat even, but under 
                         that you're a strong, pure heart, 
                         and you're the most amazingly 
                         astounding girl I've ever known and --

                                     ROSE
                         Jack, I --

                                     JACK
                         No wait. Let me try to get this out. 
                         You're amazing... and I know I have 
                         nothing to offer you, Rose. I know 
                         that. But I'm involved now. You jump, 
                         I jump, remember? I can't turn away 
                         without knowin' that you're goin' to 
                         be alright.

               Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and 
               real... not like anyone she has ever known.

                                     ROSE
                         You're making this very hard. I'll 
                         be fine. Really.

                                     JACK
                         I don't think so. They've got you in 
                         a glass jar like some butterfly, and 
                         you're goin' to die if you don't 
                         break out. Maybe not right away, 
                         'cause you're strong. But sooner or 
                         later the fire in you is goin' to go 
                         out.

                                     ROSE
                         It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         You're right. Only you can do that.

                                     ROSE
                         I have to get back, they'll miss me. 
                         Please, Jack, for both our sakes, 
                         leave me alone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - DAY

               The most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze 
               Versaille style. Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other 
               women arrayed around her. Ruth, the Countess Rothes and Lady 
               Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and still as a 
               porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her.

                                     RUTH
                         Of course the invitations had to be 
                         sent back to the printers twice. And 
                         the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell 
                         you what an odyssey that has been...

               TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on.

               REVERSE - ROSE'S POV

               A tableau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four year 
               old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. 
               The mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she 
               holds the teacup. The little girl is trying so hard to please, 
               her expression serious. A glimpse of Rose at that age, and 
               we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to becoming 
               an Edwardian geisha.

               ON ROSE

               She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling 
               tea all over her dress.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, look what I've done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC - DAY

               TITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by 
               the embers of a giant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, 
               we push in on the bow. Jack is there, right at the apex of 
               the bow railing, his favorite spot. He closes his eyes, 
               letting the chill wind clear his head.

               Jack hears her voice, behind him...

                                     ROSE
                         Hello, Jack.

               He turns and she is standing there.

                                     ROSE
                         I changed my mind.

               He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are 
               red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows 
               wildly about her face.

                                     ROSE
                         Fabrizio said you might be up --

                                     JACK
                         Sssshh. Come here.

               He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss 
               her.

                                     JACK
                         Close your eyes.

               She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship 
               is going. He presses her gently to the rail, standing right 
               behind her. Then he takes her two hands and raises them until 
               she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. Rose 
               is going along with him. When he lowers his hands, her arms 
               stay up... like wings.

                                     JACK
                         Okay. Open them.

               Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. 
               It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two 
               of them soaring. The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered 
               copper shield under a dusk sky. There is only the wind, and 
               the hiss of the water 50 feel below.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm flying!

               She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on 
               her waist to steady her.

                                     JACK
                              (singing softly)
                         Come Josephine in my flying machine...

               Rose closes her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless 
               far above the sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, 
               gently pressing her back against his chest. He pushes forward 
               slightly against her.

               Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet 
               hers... fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers 
               intertwine. Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and 
               around each other like the bodies of two lovers.

               Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting 
               the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is against 
               her ear.

               Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers 
               her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with 
               hers. He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they 
               kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, 
               surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They 
               kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.

               Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and 
               optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical 
               journey, soaring onward into a night without fear.

               IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout 
               FREDERICK FLEET nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down 
               at the figures in the bow.

                         Wish I had those bleedin' binoculars.

               JACK AND ROSE

               Embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving the 
               ruined bow of the WRECK --

               OLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present. She 
               sees the wreck on the screen, the sad ghost ship deep in the 
               abyss.

                                     ROSE
                         That was the last time Titanic ever

                         So we're up to dusk on the night of 
                         the sinking. Six hours to go.

                                     BODINE
                         Don't you love it? There's Smith, 
                         he's standing there with the iceberg 
                         warning in his fucking hand...
                              (remembering Rose)
                         ...excuse me... in his hand, and 
                         he's ordering more speed.

                         26 years of experience working against 
                         him. He figures anything big enough 
                         to sink the ship they're going to 
                         see in time to turn. But the ship's 
                         too big, with too small a rudder... 
                         it can't corner worth shit. Everything 
                         he knows is wrong.

               Rose is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau 
               comb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her hands, 
               turning it slowly. She is watching a monitor, which shows 
               the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN until the image fills 
               frame.

               ...1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin 
               upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed 
               by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbook and 
               drawing materials on the marble table.

                                     ROSE
                         Will this light do? Don't artists 
                         need good light?

                                     JACK
                              (bad French accent)
                         Zat is true, I am not used to working 
                         in such 'orreeble conditions.
                              (seeing the paintings)
                         Hey... Monet!

               He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.

                                     JACK
                         Isn't he great... the use of color? 
                         I saw him once... through a hole in 
                         this garden fence in Giverny.

               She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees 
               her go to the safe and start working the combination. He's 
               fascinated.

                                     ROSE
                         Cal insist on lugging this thing 
                         everywhere.

                                     JACK
                         Should I be expecting him anytime 
                         soon?

                                     ROSE
                         Not as long as the cigars and brandy 
                         hold out.

               CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes 
               in the mirror behind the safe. She opens it and removes the 
               necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it nervously.

                                     JACK
                         What is it? A sapphire?

                                     ROSE
                         A diamond. A very rare diamond, called 
                         the Heart of the Ocean.

               Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.

                                     ROSE
                         I want you to draw me like your French 
                         girl. Wearing this.
                              (she smiles at him)
                         Wearing only this.

               He looks up at her, surprised, and we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROSE'S BEDROOM

               ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair. She 
               shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.

               IN THE SITTING ROOM

               Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools. His 
               sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into 
               the room, wearing a silk kimono.

                                     ROSE
                         The last thing I need is another 
                         picture of me looking like a china 
                         doll. As a paying customer, I expect 
                         to get what I want.

               She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The 
               blue stone lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding 
               as she slowly lowers the robe.

               Jake looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono 
               drops to the floor (this is all in cuts, lyrical).

                                     ROSE
                         Tell me when it looks right to you.

               She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position 
               we remember from the drawing... almost.

                                     JACK
                         Uh... just bend your left leg a little 
                         and... and lower your head. Eyes to 
                         me. That's it.

               Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a 
               laugh.

                                     ROSE
                         I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big 
                         Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur 
                         Monet blushing.

                                     JACK
                              (sweating)
                         He does landscapes.

               TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the 
               top edge of his sketchpad. We have seen this image of him 
               before, in her memory. It is an image she will carry the 
               rest of her life.

               Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and 
               what emerges is the best thing he has ever done. Her pose is 
               languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her energy.

                                     OLD ROSE
                         My heart was pounding the whole time. 
                         It was the most erotic moment of my 
                         life... up till then at least.

               A semicircle of listeners staring in rapt, frozen silence.

                              (smiling)
                         You mean, did we "do it"?

               BACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her 
               kimono again, is leaning on his shoulder, watching.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.

               Rose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul.

                                     ROSE
                         Date it, Jack. I want to always 
                         remember this night.

               He does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a 
               piece of Titanic stationary. We don't see what it says. She 
               accepts the drawing from him, and crosses to the safe in the 
               wardrobe.

               She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing the drawing 
               and the note on top of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lovejoy enters from the Palm Court through the revolving 
               door and crosses the room toward Hockley. A fire is blazing 
               in the marble fireplace, and the usual fatcats are playing 
               cards, drinking and talking. Cal sees Lovejoy and detaches 
               from his group, coming to him.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         None of the stewards have seen her.

                                     CAL
                              (low but forceful)
                         This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find 
                         her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ATLANTIC - NIGHT

               TITANIC glides across an unnatural sea, black and calm as a 
               pool of oil. The ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly 
               in the black water. The sky is brilliant with stars. A meteor 
               traces a bright line across the heavens.

               ON THE BRIDGE

               Captain Smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the ship. 
               QUARTERMASTER HITCHINS brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. 
               It steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. Second 
               Officer Lightoller is next to him, staring out at the sheet 
               of black glass the Atlantic has become.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         I don't think I've ever seen such a 
                         flat calm, in 24 years at sea.

                                     SMITH
                         Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath 
                         of wind.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         It's make the bergs harder to see, 
                         with no breaking water at the base.

                                     SMITH
                         Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed 
                         and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Yes sir.

                                     SMITH
                         And wake me, of course, if anything 
                         becomes in the slightest degree 
                         doubtful.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

               Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They 
               hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him 
               silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting 
               room door.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         Miss Rose? Hello?

               He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward 
               hers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE

               Rose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. 
               She leads him quickly along the corridor toward the B deck 
               foyer. They are halfway across the open space when the sitting 
               room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy comes out. The 
               valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them.

                                     ROSE
                         Come on!

               She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and 
               gentlemen about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank 
               of elevators. They run into one, shocking the hell out of 
               the OPERATOR.

                                     ROSE
                         Take us down. Quickly, quickly!

               The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close 
               the steel gate. Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. 
               He slams one hand on the bars of the gate. Rose makes a very 
               rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs as Lovejoy disappears 
               above. The Operator gapes at her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. E-DECK FOYER / ELEVATORS

               Lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack 
               and Rose were in. The Operator is just closing the gate to 
               go back up. Lovejoy runs around the bank of elevators and 
               scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He tries the stairs 
               going down to F-Deck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. F-DECK CORRIDORS / FAN ROOM

               A functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces 
               (fan rooms, boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against 
               a wall, laughing.

                                     JACK
                         Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

                                     ROSE
                         He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father 
                         hired him to keep Cal out of 
                         trouble... to make sure he always 
                         got back to the hotel with his wallet 
                         and watch, after some crawl through 
                         the less reputable parts of town...

                                     JACK
                         Kinda like we're doin' right now -- 
                         uh oh!

               Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He 
               charges toward them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into 
               a blind alley. There is one door, marked "CREW ONLY", and 
               Jack flings it open.

               They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder 
               going down. Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy 
               slams against it a moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing 
               to the ladder.

                                     JACK
                         After you, m'lady.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOILER ROOM FIVE AND SIX

               Jack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in 
               amazement. It is like a vision of hell itself, with the 
               roaring furnaces and black figures moving in the smoky glow. 
               They run the length of the boiler room, dodging amazed 
               stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal.

                                     JACK
                              (shouting over the 
                              din)
                         Carry on! Don't mind us!

               They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM 
               SIX. Jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between 
               two boilers and they wind up in the dark, out of sight of 
               the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they see the 
               stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into 
               the insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders 
               with the roar of the fires.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

               Amid unparalleled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping 
               brandy.

                                     COLONEL GRACIE
                         We're going like hell I tell you. I 
                         have fifty dollars that says we make 
                         it into New York Tuesday night!

               Cal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOILER ROOM SIX

               The furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack 
               kisses Rose's face, tasting the sweat trickling down from 
               her forehead. They kiss passionately in the steamy, pounding 
               darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOLD #2

               Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of 
               stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the cold, after the 
               dripping heat of the boiler room.

               They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring 
               car, lashing down to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach 
               from a fairy tale, its brass trim and headlamps nicely set 
               off by its deep burgundy color.

               Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting 
               very royal. There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls 
               back there, each containing a rose. Jack jumps into the 
               driver's seat, enjoying the feel of the leather and wood.

                                     JACK
                         Where to, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         To the stars.

               ON JACK

               As her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the 
               seat into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath 
               seems loud in the quiet darkness. He looks at her and she is 
               smiling. It is the moment of truth.

                                     JACK
                         Are you nervous?

                                     ROSE
                         Au contraire, mon cher.

               He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's 
               fingers.

                                     ROSE
                         Put your hands on me Jack.

               He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his 
               welcome weight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages

               Phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby 
               ship, the Leyland freighter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his 
               outgoing signal. At such close range, the beeps are deafening.

                         shutting down.

               As Evans wearily switches off his generator, Groves goes out 
               on deck. PAN OFF him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty 
               yards from the edge of a field of pack ice and icebergs 
               stretching as far as the eye can see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC

               ON TITANIC

               Steaming hellbent through the darkness, hurling up white 
               water at the bows. The bow comes straight at us, until the 
               bow wave WIPES THE FRAME --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOLD #2

               PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is 
               completely fogged up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against 
               the glass for a moment, making a handprint in the veil of 
               condensation.

               INSIDE THE CAR

               Jack's overcoat is like a blanket over them. It stirs and 
               Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, 
               still mostly clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look 
               at each other wonderingly. She puts her hand on his face, as 
               if making sure he is real.

                                     ROSE
                         You're trembling.

                                     JACK
                         It's okay. I'm alright.

               He lays his cheek against her chest.

                                     JACK
                         I can feel your heart beating.

               She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear 
               life.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         Well, I wasn't the first teenage 
                         girl to get seduced in the backseat 
                         of a car, and certainly not the last, 
                         by several million. He had such fine 
                         hands, artists' hands, but strong 
                         too... roughened by work. I remember 
                         their touch even now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ATLANTIC / TITANIC - NIGHT

               The bow sweeps under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the 
               foremast and the tiny half-cylinder of the crow's nest, which 
               grows as we push in on lookouts Fleet and Lee. They are 
               stamping their feet and swinging their arms, trying to keep 
               warm in the 22 knot freezing wind, which whips capor of their 
               breath away behind.

                                     FLEET
                         You can smell ice, you know, when 
                         it's near.

                                     LEE
                         Bollocks.

                                     FLEET
                         Well I can.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOILER ROOM SIX

               Without hearing the words over the roar of the furnaces, we 
               see stokers telling TWO STEWARDS which way Rose and Jack 
               went. The stewards move off toward the forward holds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE

               Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of 
               Rose and his face clenches with fury. He reads the not again: 
               "DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US BOTH LOCKED IN YOUR SAFE, ROSE".

               Lovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the 
               drawing. Cal crumples Rose's note, then takes the drawing in 
               both hands as if to rip it in half. He tenses to do it, then 
               stops himself.

                                     CAL
                         I have a better idea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOLD #2 - NIGHT

               The two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play 
               the beams around the hold. They spot the Renault with its 
               fogged up rear window and approach it slowly.

               FROM INSIDE

               We see the torch light up Rose's passionate handprint, still 
               there on the fogged up glass. One steward whips open the 
               door.

                                     STEWARD
                         Got yer!

               REVERSE:

               The back seat is empty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK AND CROW'S NEST - NIGHT

               Rose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto 
               the deck. They can barely stand, they are laughing so hard.

               UP ABOVE THEM, IN THE CROW'S NEST, lookout Fleet hears the 
               disturbance below and looks around and back down to the well 
               deck, where he can see two figures embracing.

               Jack and Rose stand in each others arms. Their breath clouds 
               around them in the now freezing air, but they don't even 
               feel the cold.

                                     ROSE
                         When this ship docks, I'm getting 
                         off with you.

                                     JACK
                         This is crazy.

                                     ROSE
                         I know. It doesn't make any sense. 
                         That's why I trust it.

               Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.

               IN THE CROW'S NEST

               Fleet nudges Lee.

                                     FLEET
                         Cor... look at that, would ya.

                                     LEE
                         They're a bloody sight warmer than 
                         we are.

                                     FLEET
                         Well if that's what it takes for us 
                         two to get warm, I'd rather not, if 
                         it's all the same.

               They both have a good laugh at that one. It is Fleet whose 
               expression falls first. Glancing forward again, he does a 
               double take. The color drains out of his face.

               FLEET'S POV

               A massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out.

                                     FLEET
                         Bugger me!!

               Fleet reaches past Lee and rings the lookout bell three times, 
               then grabs the telephone, calling the bridge. He waits 
               precious seconds for it to be picket up, never taking his 
               eyes off the black mass ahead.

                                     FLEET
                         Pick up, ya bastard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. / EXT. BRIDGE

               Inside the enclosed wheelhouse, SIXTH OFFICER MOODY walks 
               unhurriedly to the telephone, picking it up.

                                     FLEET (V.O.)
                         Is someone there?

                                     MOODY
                         Yes. What do you see?

                                     FLEET
                         Iceberg right ahead!

                                     MOODY
                         Thank you.
                              (hangs up, calls to 
                              Murdoch)
                         Iceberg right ahead!

               Murdoch sees it and rushes to the engine room telegraph. 
               While signaling "FULL SPEED ASTERN" he yells to Quartermaster 
               Hitchins, who is at the wheel.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Hard a' starboard.

                                     MOODY
                              (standing behind 
                              Hitchins)
                         Hard a' starboard. The helm is hard 
                         over, sir.

               CRASH SEQUENCE / SERIES OF CUTS:

               CHIEF ENGINEER BELL is just checking the soup he has warming 
               on a steam manifold when the engine telegraph clangs, then 
               goes... incredibly... to FULL SPEED ASTERN. He and the other 
               ENGINEERS just stare at it a second, unbelieving. Then Bell 
               reacts.

                                     BELL
                         Full astern! FULL ASTERN!!

               The engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves 
               and start braking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, 
               to a stop.

               IN BOILER ROOM SIX

               Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with 2nd Engineer 
               JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and "STOP" indicator 
               come on.

                                     BARRETT
                         Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!!

               FROM THE BRIDGE

               Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The bow 
               finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse 
               of the helm setting).

               Murdoch's jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing 
               slowness. He holds his breath as the horrible physics play 
               out.

               IN THE CROW'S NEST

               Frederick Fleet braces himself.

               THE BOW OF THE SHIP

               Thunders right at CAMERA and --

               KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow.

               UNDERWATER

               We see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The iceberg 
               bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as 
               the steel plate of the hull flexes under the load.

               IN #2 HOLD

               The two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet 
               with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along 
               outside the ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the 
               sea pours in, sweeping them off their feet. The icy water 
               swirls around the Renault as the men scramble for the stairs.

               ON G-DECK

               Forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He 
               hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate 
               on ice.

               IN BOILER ROOM SIX

               Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING THUNDER 
               of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship 
               buckle in toward them and are almost swept off their feet by 
               a rush of water coming in about two feet above the floor.

               ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK

               Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in astonishment 
               as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain. 
               Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and 
               they have to jump back to avoid flying chunks of ice.

               ON THE BRIDGE

               Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quickly throws 
               the switch that closes them.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Hard a' port!

               Judging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the 
               stern.

               BARRETT AND HESKETH

               Hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the swirling water 
               to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The 
               room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red 
               hot furnaces. Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through 
               the door as it comes down like a slow guillotine.

                                     BARRETT
                         Go Lads! Go! Go!

               He dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door 
               rumbles down with a CLANG.

               JACK AND ROSE

               Rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving 
               aft down the side of the ship.

               In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making 
               notes in his ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound 
               of a cut-crystal light fixture tinkling like a windchime.

               He feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in 
               his face. Too much of his soul is in this great ship for him 
               not to feel its mortal wound.

               IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

               Gracie watches his highball vibrating on the table.

               IN THE PALM COURT

               With its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up her drink 
               to a passing waiter.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hey, can I get some ice here, please?

               Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. 
               She doesn't see it. It disappears astern.

               IN THE CROW'S NEST

               Fleet turns to his Lee...

                                     FLEET
                         Oy, mate... that was a close shave.

                                     LEE
                         Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. / EXT. BRIDGE

               CLOSE ON MURDOCH

               The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to reflect 
               his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on 
               what just happened. He just ran the biggest ship in history 
               into an iceberg on its maiden voyage.

                                     MURDOCH
                              (stiffly, to Moody)
                         Note the time. Enter it in the log.

               Captain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking 
               in his shirt.

                                     SMITH
                         What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

                                     MURDOCH
                         An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' 
                         starboard and run the engines full 
                         astern, but it was too close. I tried 
                         to port around it, but she hi... and 
                         I --

                                     SMITH
                         Close the emergency doors.

                                     MURDOCH
                         The doors are closed.

               Together they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch 
               points. Smith looks into the darkness aft, then wheels around 
               to FOURTH OFFICER BOHALL.

                                     SMITH
                         Find the Carpenter and get him to 
                         sound the ship.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. G-DECK FORWARD

               In steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's 
               going on. He sees dozens of rats running toward him in the 
               corridor, fleeing the flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as 
               the rats run by.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         Ma -- che cazzo!

               IN HIS STATEROOM

               Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops down to 
               the floor. SPLASH!!

                                     TOMMY
                         Cor!! What in hell?!

               He snaps on the light. The floor is covered with 3 inches of 
               freezing water, and more coming in. He pulls the door open, 
               and steps out into the corridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio 
               is running toward him, yelling something in Italian. Tommy 
               and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting everybody up 
               and out. The alarm spreads in several languages.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR / A-DECK

               A couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes 
               and slippers. A STEWARD hurries along, reassuring them.

                                     WOMAN
                         Why have the engines stopped? I felt 
                         a shudder?

                                     STEWARD #1
                         I shouldn't worry, m'am. We've likely 
                         thrown a propeller blade, that's the 
                         shudder you felt. May I bring you 
                         anything?

               THOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying 
               an armload of rolled up ship's plans.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK

               Jack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking 
               at the hull of the ship.

                                     JACK
                         Looks okay. I don't see anything.

                                     ROSE
                         Could it have damaged the ship?

                                     JACK
                         It didn't seem like much of a bump. 
                         I'm sure we're okay.

               Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice 
               around the deck, laughing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEERAGE FORWARD

               Fabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging 
               the corridors, heading aft away from the flooding. Many of 
               them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags, some of which 
               are soaked.

                                     TOMMY
                         If this is the direction the rats 
                         were runnin', it's good enough for 
                         me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR ON B DECK

               Bruce Ismay, dressed in pajamas under the topcoat, hurries 
               down the corridor, headed for the bridge. An officious steward 
               named BARNES comes along the other direction, getting the 
               few concerned passengers back into their rooms.

                                     STEWARD BARNES
                         There's no cause for alarm. Please, 
                         go back to your rooms.

               He is stopped in his tracks by Cal and Lovejoy.

                                     STEWARD BARNES
                         Please, sir. There's no emergency --

                                     CAL
                         Yes there is, I have been robbed. 
                         Now get the Master at Arms. Now you 
                         moron!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM

               CLOSEUP OF CAPTAIN SMITH studying the commutator.

               He turns to Andrews, standing behind him.

                                     SMITH
                         A five degree list in less than ten 
                         minutes.

               SHIP'S CARPENTER JOHN HUTCHINSON enters behind him, out of 
               breath and clearly unnerved.

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         She's making water fast... in the 
                         forepeak tank and the forward holds, 
                         in boiler room six.

               Ismay enters, his movements quick with anger and frustration. 
               Smith glances at him with annoyance.

                                     ISMAY
                         Why have we stopped?

                                     SMITH
                         We've struck ice.

                                     ISMAY
                         Well, do you think the ship is 
                         seriously damaged?

                                     SMITH
                              (glaring)
                         Excuse me.

               Smith pushes past him, with Andrews and Hutchinson in tow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOILER ROOM

               Strokers and firemen are struggling to draw the fires. They 
               are working in waist deep water churning around as it flows 
               into the boiler room, ice cold and swirling with grease from 
               the machinery. Chief Engineer Bell comes partway down the 
               ladder and shouts.

                                     BELL
                         That's it, lads. Get the hell up!

               They scramble up the escape ladders.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. B-DECK FORWARD / WELL DECK

               The gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward 
               rail watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of 
               ice.

                                     GENTLEMAN
                         I guess it's nothing too serious. 
                         I'm going back to my cabin to read.

               A 20ish YALE MAN pops through the door wearing a topcoat 
               over pajamas.

                                     YALEY
                         Say, did I miss the fun?

               Rose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which 
               are right next to the three men. They stare as the couple 
               climbs over the locked gate.

               A moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by 
               Andrews and Carpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from 
               the bridge by the outside stairs. The three men, their faces 
               grim, crush right past Jack and Rose. Andrews barely glances 
               at her.

                                     SMITH
                         Can you shore up?

                                     HUTCHINSON
                         Not unless the pumps get ahead.

               The inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck.

                                     JACK
                              (low, to her)
                         It's bad.

                                     ROSE
                         We have to tell Mother and Cal.

                                     JACK
                         Now it's worse.

                                     ROSE
                         Come with me, Jack. I jump, you 
                         jump... Right?

                                     JACK
                         Right.

               Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. B-DECK FOYER / CORRIDOR

               Jack and Rose cross the foyer, entering the corridor. Lovejoy 
               is waiting for them in the hall as they approach the room.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         We've been looking for you miss.

               Lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and 
               smoothly slips the diamond necklace into the pocket of his 
               overcoat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

               Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master 
               at Arms and two stewards (Steward #1 and Barnes). Silence as 
               Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when 
               she sees Jack.

                                     ROSE
                         Something serious has happened.

                                     CAL
                         That's right. Two things dear to me 
                         have disappeared this evening. Now 
                         that one is back...
                              (he looks from Rose 
                              to Jack)
                         ...I have a pretty good idea where 
                         to find the other.
                              (to Master at Arms)
                         Search him.

               The Master at Arms steps up to Jack.

                                     MASTER AT ARMS
                         Coat off, mate.

               Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in 
               dismay, shrugging out of it. The Master at Arms pats him 
               down.

                                     JACK
                         This is horseshit.

                                     ROSE
                         Cal, you can't be serious! We're in 
                         the middle of an emergency and you --

               Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket 
               of Jack's coat.

                                     STEWARD BARNES
                         Is this it?

               Rose is stunned. Needless to say, so is Jack.

                                     CAL
                         That's it.

                                     MASTER AT ARMS
                         Right then. Now don't make a fuss.

               He starts to handcuff Jack.

                                     JACK
                         Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!

                                     ROSE
                              (uncertain)
                         He couldn't have.

                                     CAL
                         Of course he could. Easy enough for 
                         a professional. He memorized the 
                         combination when you opened the safe.

               FLASHBACK

               Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's 
               eyes as he stands behind her, watching.

                                     ROSE
                         But I was with him the whole time.

                                     CAL
                              (just to her, low and 
                              cold)
                         Maybe he did it while you were putting 
                         your clothes back on.

                                     JACK
                         They put it in my pocket!

                                     LOVEJOY
                              (holding Jack's coat)
                         It's not even your pocket, son.
                              (reading)
                         "Property of A. L. Ryerson".

               Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a 
               label inside the collar with the owner's name.

                                     MASTER AT ARMS
                         That was reported stolen today.

                                     JACK
                         I was going to return it! Rose --

               Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks 
               away from him. He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the 
               Master at Arms drag him out into the hall. She can't look 
               him in the eye.

                                     JACK
                         Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't 
                         do this! You know I didn't! You know 
                         it!

               She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her 
               shoulder as the tears well up.

                                     RUTH
                         Why do women believe men?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD

               Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting 
               Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the 
               racks. They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from 
               the hold below.

               Andrews climbs part way down the stairs to the hold, which 
               is almost full. Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights 
               are still on below the surface, casting an eerie glow. The 
               Renault is visible under the water, the brass glinting 
               cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, 
               and scrambles back up the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIDE / CHARTROOM

               Andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom 
               table. It is a side elevation, showing all the watertight 
               bulkheads. His hands are shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover 
               behind Andrews and the Captain.

                                     ISMAY
                         When can we get underway, do you 
                         think?

               Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' 
               drawing. The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Water 14 feet above the keel in ten 
                         minutes... in the forepeak... in all 
                         three holds... and in boiler room 
                         six.

                                     SMITH
                         That's right.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Five compartments. She can stay afloat 
                         with the first four compartments 
                         breached. But not five. Not five. As 
                         she goes down by the head the water 
                         will spill over the tops of the 
                         bulkheads... at E Deck... from one 
                         to the next... back and back. There's 
                         no stopping it.

                                     SMITH
                         The pumps --

                                     ANDREWS
                         The pumps buy you time... but minutes 
                         only. From this moment, no matter 
                         what we do, Titanic will founder.

                                     ISMAY
                         But this ship can't sink!

                                     ANDREWS
                         She is made of iron, sir. I assure 
                         you, she can. And she will. It is a 
                         mathematical certainty.

               Smith looks like he has been gutpunched.

                                     SMITH
                         How much time?

                                     ANDREWS
                         An hour, two at most.

               Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.

                                     SMITH
                         And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

                                     MURDOCH
                         Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, 
                         sir.

               A long beat. Smith turns to his employer.

                                     SMITH
                         I believe you may get your headlines, 
                         Mr. Ismay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK

               Andrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and 
               officers scurry to uncover the boats. Steam is venting from 
               pipes on the funnels overhead, and the din is horrendous. 
               Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of 
               disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the 
               mechanism of one of the Wellin davits and yells to them over 
               the roar of steam.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Turn to the right! Pull the falls 
                         taut before you unchock. Have you 
                         never had a boat drill?

                                     SEAMAN
                         No sir! Not with these new davits, 
                         sir.

               He looks around, disgusted as the crew fumble with the davits, 
               and the tackle for the "falls"... the ropes which are used 
               to lower the boats. A few passengers are coming out on deck, 
               hesitantly in the noise and bitter cold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

               From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices 
               in the corridor.

                                     RUTH
                         I had better go dress.

               Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly 
               for a moment, then SLAPS her across the face.

                                     CAL
                         It is a little slut, isn't it?

               To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her 
               heart has been given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly.

                                     CAL
                         Look at me, you little --

               There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The 
               door opens and their steward puts his head in.

                                     STEWARD BARNES
                         Sir, I've been told to ask you to 
                         please put on your lifebelt, and 
                         come up to the boat deck.

                                     CAL
                         Get out. We're busy.

               The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down 
               from the top of a dresser.

                                     STEWARD
                         I'm sorry about the inconvenience, 
                         Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's 
                         orders. Please dress warmly, it's 
                         quite cold tonight.
                              (he hands a lifebelt 
                              to Rose)
                         Not to worry, miss, I'm sure it's 
                         just a precaution.

                                     CAL
                         This is ridiculous.

               In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and 
               obsequious they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. 
               However, it's another story in...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT

               BLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights 
               snapped on by a steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a 
               sound sleep.

                                     STEWARD #2
                         Everybody up. Let's go. Put your 
                         lifebelts on.

               IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE

               Another steward is going from door to door along the hall, 
               pouncing and yelling.

                                     STEWARD #2
                         Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody 
                         up, come on. Lifebelts on...

               People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. 
               In the foreground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was 
               said. He shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         CQD, sir?

                                     SMITH
                         That's right. The distress call. 
                         CQD. Tell whoever responds that we 
                         are going down by the head and need 
                         immediate assistance.

               Smith hurries out.

                                     PHILLIPS
                         Blimey.

                                     BRIDE
                         Maybe you ought to try that new 
                         distress call... S.O.S.
                              (grinning)
                         It may be our only chance to use it.

               Phillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending 
               history's first S.O.S. Dit dit dit, da da da, dit dit dit... 
               over and over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK

               Thomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty 
               except for the crew fumbling with the davits. He yells over 
               the roar of the steam to First Officer Murdoch.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Where are all the passengers?

                                     MURDOCH
                         They've all gone back inside. Too 
                         damn cold and noisy for them.

               Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his 
               pocketwatch and heads for the foyer entrance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A-DECK FOYER

               A large number of First Class passengers have gathered near 
               the staircase. They are getting indignant about the confusion. 
               Molly Brown snags a passing YOUNG STEWARD.

                                     MOLLY
                         What's doing, sonny? You've got us 
                         all trussed up and now we're cooling 
                         our heels.

               The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the 
               stairs.

                                     YOUNG STEWARD
                         Sorry, mum. Let me go and find out.

               The jumpy piano rhythm of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" comes 
               out of the first class lounge a few yards away. Band leader 
               WALLACE HARTLEY has assembled some of his men on Captain's 
               orders, to allay panic.

               Hockley's entourage comes up to the A-deck foyer. Cal is 
               carrying the lifebelts, almost as an afterthought. Rose is 
               like a sleepwalker.

                                     CAL
                         It's just the God damned English 
                         doing everything by the book.

                                     RUTH
                         There's no need for language, Mr. 
                         Hockley.
                              (to Trudy)
                         Go back and turn the heater on in my 
                         room, so it won't be too cold when 
                         we get back.

               Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, 
               which he knows is doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his 
               heartbroken expression. She walks over to him and Cal goes 
               after her.

                                     ROSE
                         I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And 
                         I see it in your eyes. Please tell 
                         me the truth.

                                     ANDREWS
                         The ship will sink.

                                     ROSE
                         You're certain?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Yes. In an hour or so... all this... 
                         will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

                                     CAL
                         My God.

               Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Please tell only who you must, I 
                         don't want to be responsible for a 
                         panic. And get to a boat quickly. 
                         Don't wait. You remember what I told 
                         you about the boats?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, I understand. Thank you.

               Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging 
               them to put on their lifebelts and get to the boats.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

               Lovejoy and the Master at Arms are handcuffing Jack to a 4" 
               WATER PIPE as a crewman rushes in anxiously and almost blurts 
               to the Master at Arms --

                                     CREWMAN
                         You're wanted by the Purser, sir. 
                         Urgently.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

               Lovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt .45 automatic from under 
               his coat. The Master at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff 
               key to Lovejoy, then exits with the crewman. Lovejoy flips 
               the key in the air. Catches it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIDGE

               Junior Wireless Operator Bride is relaying a message to 
               Captain Smith from the CUNARD LINER CARPATHIA.

                                     BRIDE
                         Carpathia says they're making 17 
                         knots, full steam for them, sir.

                                     SMITH
                         And she's the only one who's 
                         responding?

                                     BRIDE
                         The only one close, sir. She says 
                         they can be here in four hours.

                                     SMITH
                         Four hours!

               The enormity of it hits Smith like a sledgehammer blow.

                                     SMITH
                         Thank you, Bride.

               He turns as Bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness.

                                     SMITH
                              (to himself)
                         My God.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT

               Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a 
               crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and 
               undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others are in 
               stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and 
               overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are 
               in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over 
               velvet gowns, then topping it with sole stoles. Some brought 
               jewels, others books, even small dogs.

               Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly 
               goes to him. He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped 
               hands, over the roar of the steam...

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Hadn't we better get the women and 
                         children into the boats, sir?

               Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of 
               him. Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                              (to the men)
                         Right! Start the loading. Women and 
                         children!

               The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving 
               a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes.

               ON WALLACE HARTLEY

               Raising his violin to play.

                                     HARTLEY
                         Number 26. Ready and --

               The band has reassembled just outside the First Class 
               Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for 
               the boats to be loaded. They strike up a waltz, lively and 
               elegant. The music wafts all over the ship.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Ladies, please. Step into the boat.

               Finally one woman steps across the gap, into the boat, 
               terrified of the drop to the water far below.

                                     WOMAN IN CROWD
                         You watch. They'll put us off in 
                         these silly little boats to freeze, 
                         and we'll all be back on board by 
                         breakfast.

               Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band.

                                     RUTH
                         My brooch, I left my brooch. I must 
                         have it!

               She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the 
               arm, refusing to let her go. The firmness of his hold 
               surprises her.

                                     CAL
                         Stay here, Ruth.

               Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL

               It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow 
               corridors clogged with people carrying suitcases, duffel 
               bags, children. Some have lifebelts on, others don't.

                                     STEWARD #2
                              (to Steward #3)
                         I told the stupid sods no luggage. 
                         Aw, bloody hell!

               He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down 
               with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor.

               Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other 
               way. They reach a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the 
               MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest 
               of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in 
               hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him.

               Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. 
               There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with 
               several stewards and seamen on the other side.

                                     STEWARD
                         Stay calm, please. It's not time to 
                         go up to the boats yet.

               Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small 
               children and their battered luggage.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         What are we doing, mummy?

                                     WOMAN
                         We're just waiting, dear. When they 
                         finish putting First Class people in 
                         the boats, they'll be startin' with 
                         us, and we'll want to be all ready, 
                         won't we?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STARBOARD SIDE

               Boat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made 
               for 65.

                                     FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH
                         Lower away! By the left and right 
                         together, steady lads!

               The boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the 
               pulley blocks. The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying 
               and jerking, toward the water 60 feet below. The passengers 
               are terrified.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. TITANIC HULL AND MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

               TRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the 
               water. Under the surface, they glow green.

               PUSHING IN on one porthole which is half submerged. Inside 
               we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising up 
               the glass.

               INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE

               Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next to the porthole. 
               Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bullet on 
               the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks 
               up the bullet.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         You know... I believe this ship may 
                         sink.
                              (crosses to Jack)
                         I've been asked to give you this 
                         small token of our appreciation...

               He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out 
               of him.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

               Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and 
               puts it in his pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, 
               handcuffed to the pipe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD

               At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer 
               Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress 
               rocket. It shoots into the sky and EXPLODES with a thunderclap 
               over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up 
               the entire deck as they fall.

               WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director 
               of White Star Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point 
               from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him. He starts 
               shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of BOAT 
               5.

                                     ISMAY
                         There is no time to waste!
                              (yelling and waving 
                              his arms)
                         Lower away! Lower away! Lower away!

               FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, 
               looks up from the tangled falls at the madman.

                                     LOWE
                         Get out of the way, you fool!

                                     ISMAY
                         Do you know who I am?

               Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay.

                                     LOWE
                         You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's 
                         bloody officer. Now do what you're 
                         told!
                              (turning away)
                         Steady men! Stand by the falls!

                                     ISMAY
                              (numbly, backing away)
                         Yes, quite right. Sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE

               SECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal 
               and Rose... Boat 6.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Women and children only! Sorry sir, 
                         no men yet.

               Another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled 
               faces turn upward. Fear now in the eyes.

               DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... 
               hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has 
               Mary posed in front of the scene at the boats.

                                     MARVIN
                         You're afraid, darling. Scared to 
                         death. That's it!

               Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified.

               ROSE watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her 
               as they step closer to the boat. Husbands saying goodbye to 
               wives and children. Lovers and friends parted. Nearby MOLLY 
               is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat.

                         Come on, you heard the man. Get in 
                         the boat, sister.

                                     RUTH
                         Will the lifeboats be seated according 
                         to class? I hope they're not too 
                         crowded --

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, Mother shut up!
                              (Ruth freezes, mouth 
                              open)
                         Don't you understand? The water is 
                         freezing and there aren't enough 
                         boats... not enough by half. Half 
                         the people on this ship are going to 
                         die.

                                     CAL
                         Not the better half.

               PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. 
               Jack is third class. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket 
               bursts overhead, bathing her face in white light.

                                     ROSE
                         You unimaginable bastard.

                                     MOLLY
                         Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These 
                         are the first class seats right up 
                         here. That's it.

               Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks 
               around for some other women who might need a push.

                                     MOLLY
                         Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'.

               Rose steps back, shaking her head.

                                     RUTH
                         Rose, get in the boat!

                                     ROSE
                         Goodbye, mother.

               Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal 
               grabs Rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through 
               the crowd. Cal catches up to Rose and grabs her again, 
               roughly.

                                     CAL
                         Where are you going? To him? Is that 
                         it? To be a whore to that gutter 
                         rat?

                                     ROSE
                         I'd rather be his whore than your 
                         wife.

               He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling 
               her back toward the lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and 
               jabs him with it. He lets go with a curse and she runs into 
               the crowd.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Lower away!!

                                     RUTH
                         Rose! ROSE!!

                                     MOLLY
                         Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. 
                         She'll be along.

               The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out.

               TRACKING WITH ROSE, as she runs through the clusters of 
               people. She looks back and a furious Cal is coming after 
               her. She runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men.

                                     ROSE
                         That man tried to take advantage of 
                         me in the crowd!

               Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose 
               runs on as the two men grab Cal, restraining him. She runs 
               through the First Class entrance.

               Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, 
               but runs into a knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely 
               through them...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / STAIRCASE / A-DECK FOYER

               Cal runs in, and down to the landing, pushing past the 
               gentlemen and ladies who are filling up the stairs. He scans 
               the A-deck foyer. Rose is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC / BOAT

               The hull of Titanic looms over Boat 6 like a cliff. Its 
               enormous mass is suddenly threatening to those in the tiny 
               boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, at the tiller, wants nothing 
               but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his two seamen 
               can't row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing.

                                     HITCHINS
                         Keep pulling... away from the ship. 
                         Pull.

                                     MOLLY
                         Ain't you boys ever rowed before? 
                         Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya 
                         how it's done.

               She climbs over Ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her 
               feet.

               Around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in 
               the water, others being lowered.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR

               Jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength. It's not 
               budging. He hears gurgling sound. Water pours under the door, 
               spreading rapidly across the floor.

                                     JACK
                         Shit.

               He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until 
               the skin is raw... no good.

                                     JACK
                         Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear 
                         me?!
                              (to himself)
                         This could be bad.

               THE CORRIDOR

               Outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep. Jack's 
               voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to 
               hear it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR

               Thomas Andrews is opening stateroom doors, checking that 
               people are out.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Anyone in here?

               Rose runs up to him, breathless.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would 
                         the Master at Arms take someone under 
                         arrest?!

                                     ANDREWS
                         What? You have to get to a boat right 
                         away!

                                     ROSE
                         No! I'll do this with or without 
                         your help, sir. But without will 
                         take longer.

                                     ANDREWS
                              (beat)
                         Take the elevator to the very bottom, 
                         go left, down the crewman's passage, 
                         then make a right.

                                     ROSE
                         Bottom, left, right. I have it.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Hurry, Rose.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FOYER / ELEVATORS

               Rose runs up as the last Elevator Operator is closing up his 
               lift to leave.

                                     OPERATOR
                         Sorry, miss, lifts are closed --

               Without thinking she grabs him and shoves him back into the 
               lift.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm through with being polite, 
                         goddamnit!! I may never be polite 
                         the rest of my life! Now take me 
                         down!!

               The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN / BOAT

               Molly and the two seamen are rowing, and they've made it a 
               hundred feet or so. Enough to see that the ship is angled 
               down into the water, with the bow rail less than ten feet 
               above the surface.

                                     MOLLY
                         Come on girls, join in, it'll keep 
                         ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar!

               Ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its 
               rows of lights blazing, slanting down into the sullen black 
               mirror of the Atlantic.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS ELEVATOR / CORRIDORS

               Through the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can 
               see the decks going past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER 
               is swirling around her legs. She SCREAMS in surprise. So 
               does the operator.

               The car has landed in a foot of freezing water, shocking the 
               hell out of her. She claws the door open and splashes out, 
               hiking up her floor-length skirt so she can move. The lift 
               goes back up, behind her, as she looks around.

                                     ROSE
                         Left, crew passage.

               She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place 
               is understandably deserted. She is on her own.

                                     ROSE
                         Right, right... right.

               She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A 
               row of doors on each side.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack? Jaaacckk??

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR

               Jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until 
               he turns red. He collapses back on the bench, realizing he's 
               screwed. Then he hears her through the door.

                                     JACK
                         ROSE!! In here!

               IN THE HALL

               Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back, 
               locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a 
               small wave.

               She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him.

                                     ROSE
                         Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm 
                         so sorry.

               They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing.

                                     JACK
                         That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

                                     ROSE
                         I know, I know.

                                     JACK
                         See if you can find a key for these. 
                         Try those drawers. It's a little 
                         brass one.

               She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go 
               through the desk.

                                     JACK
                         So... how did you find out I didn't 
                         do it?

                                     ROSE
                         I didn't.
                              (she looks at him)
                         I just realized I already knew.

               They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, 
               searching drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the 
               porthole and looks out.

               A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC / BOAT ONE

               While the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to 
               the hull. Lucile and Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon sit with ten others 
               in a boat made for four times that many.

                                     LUCILE
                         I despise small boats. I just know 
                         I'm going to be seasick. I always 
                         get seasick in small boats. Good 
                         Heavens, there's a man down there.

               In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking 
               up at her... a face in a bubble of light under the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Rose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing 
               hard.

                                     ROSE
                         There's no key in here.

               They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. 
               Jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench.

                                     JACK
                         You have to go for help.

                                     ROSE
                              (nodding)
                         I'll be right back.

                                     JACK
                         I'll wait here.

               She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, 
               then splashes away. Jack looks down at the swirling water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS

               Rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the 
               next deck. She climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a 
               trail like a giant snail. The weight of it is really slowing 
               her down. She rips at the buttons and shimmies quickly out 
               of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and 
               knee-length slip, to find herself in --

               A LONG CORRIDOR

               Part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward. She is 
               alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the 
               hall as the ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, 
               unimpeded now.

                                     ROSE
                         Hello? Somebody?!

               She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. 
               The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting 
               the light. The margin of the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG 
               MAN appears, running through the water, sending up geysers 
               of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes 
               crazed...

                                     ROSE
                         Help me! We need help!

               He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs 
               with terrifying sounds.

               The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A 
               beat. Then they come back on. She finds herself 
               hyperventilating. That one moment of blackness was the most 
               terrifying of her life.

               A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of 
               lifebelts. He is upset to see someone still in his section. 
               He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him 
               like a wayward child.

                                     STEWARD
                         Come on, then, let's get you topside, 
                         miss, that's right.

                                     ROSE
                         Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's --

                                     STEWARD
                         No need for panic, miss. Come along!

                                     ROSE
                         No, let me go! You're going the wrong 
                         way!

               He's not listening. And he won't let her go.

               She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him 
               squarely in the nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers 
               back.

                                     STEWARD
                         To Hell with you!

                                     ROSE
                         See you there, buster!

               The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits 
               after him. Just the way Jack taught her.

               She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. 
               She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying 
               discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way 
               she came.

               AT THE STAIRWELL

               She looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the bottom 
               five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along 
               the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped.

               Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and 
               powers forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. 
               She grimaces at the pain from the literally freezing water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

               Jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the 
               waterpipe. Rose wades in, holding the axe above her head.

                                     ROSE
                         Will this work?

                                     JACK
                         We'll find out.

               They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He 
               positions the chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it 
               taut across the steel pipe. The chain is of course very short, 
               and his exposed wrists are on either side of it.

                                     JACK
                         Try a couple practice swings.

               Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.

                                     JACK
                         Now try to hit the same mark again.

               She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the 
               mark.

                                     JACK
                         Okay, that's enough practice.

               He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to 
               hit a target about an inch wide with all the force she can 
               muster, with his hands on either side.

                                     JACK
                              (sounding calm)
                         You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard 
                         as you can, I trust you.

               Jack closes his eyes. So does she.

               The axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes 
               looks... Jack is grinning with two separate cuffs.

               Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.

                                     JACK
                         Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.

               He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe 
               for a second.

                                     JACK
                         Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, 
                         that is cold! Come on, let's go.

               They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stairs 
               going up, but Jack stops her. There is only about a foot of 
               the stairwell opening visible.

                                     JACK
                         Too deep. We gotta find another way 
                         out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT 6 AND TITANIC

               TIGHT ON THE LETTERS TITANIC painted two feet high on the 
               bow of the doomed steamer. Once 50 feet above the waterline, 
               they now quietly slip below the surface. We see them, gold 
               on black, rippling and dimming to a pale green as they go 
               deeper.

               IN BOAT SIX

               Ruth looks back at the Titanic, transfixed by the sight of 
               the dying liner. The bowsprit is now barely above the 
               waterline. Another of Boxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. K-
               BOOM! It lights up the whole area, and we see half a dozen 
               boats in the water, spreading out from the ship.

                                     MOLLY
                         Now there's somethin' you don't see 
                         every day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SCOTLAND ROAD / E-DECK

               The widest passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and 
               steerage alike, and runs almost the length of the ship. Right 
               now steerage passengers move along it like refugees, heading 
               aft.

               CRASH! A wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open 
               under the force of Jack's shoulder. Jack and Rose stumble 
               through, into the corridor. A STEWARD, who was nearby herding 
               people along, marches over.

                                     STEWARD
                         Here you! You'll have to pay for 
                         that, you know. That's White Star 
                         Line property --

                                     JACK AND ROSE
                              (turning together)
                         Shut up!

               Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the 
               steerage stragglers going aft. In places the corridor is 
               almost completely blocked by large families carrying all 
               their luggage.

               An IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than 
               because she is blue-lipped and shivering.

                                     IRISH WOMAN
                         Here, lass, cover yerself.

               Jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk 
               along. The woman's husband offers them a flask of whiskey.

                                     IRISH MAN
                         This'll take the chill off.

               Rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to Jack. He grins and 
               follows suit. Jack tries a number of DOORS and IRON GATES 
               along the way, finding them all locked.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK

               ON THE BOAT DECK

               The action has moved to the aft group of boats, numbers 9, 
               11, 13 and 15 on the starboard side, and 10, 12, 14 and 16 
               on the port side. The pace of work is more frantic. You see 
               crew and officers running now to work the davits, their 
               previous complacency gone.

               Cal pushes through the crowd, scanning for Rose. Around him 
               is chaos and confusion. A woman is calling for a child who 
               has become separated from the crowd. A man is shouting over 
               people's heads. A woman takes hold of Second Officer 
               Lightoller's arm as he is about to launch Boat 10.

                                     WOMAN
                         Will you hold the boat a moment? I 
                         have to run back to my room for 
                         something --

               Lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat. 
               Thomas Andrews rushes up to him just then.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Why are the boats being launched 
                         half full?!

               Lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled 
               fall.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Not now, Mr. Andrews.

                                     ANDREWS
                              (pointing down at the 
                              water)
                         There, look... twenty or so in a 
                         boat built for sixty five. And I saw 
                         one boat with only twelve. Twelve!

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Well... we were not sure of the weight --

                                     ANDREWS
                         Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast 
                         with the weight of 70 men. Now fill 
                         these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For 
                         God's sake, man!

               The shot HANDS OFF to Cal, who sees Lovejoy hurrying toward 
               him through the aisle connecting the port and starboard sides 
               of the boat deck.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         She's not on the starboard side 
                         either.

                                     CAL
                         We're running out of time. And this 
                         strutting martinet...
                              (indicating Lightoller)
                         ...isn't letting any men in at all.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         The one on the other side is letting 
                         men in.

                                     CAL
                         Then that's our play. But we're still 
                         going to need some insurance.
                              (he starts off forward)
                         Come on.

               Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The 
               SHOT HANDS OFF to a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and 
               ISADOR STRAUSS.

                                     ISADOR
                         Please, Ida, get into the boat.

                                     IDA
                         No. We've been together for forty 
                         years, and where you go, I go. Don't 
                         argue with me, Isador, you know it 
                         does no good.

               He looks at her with sadness and great love. They embrace 
               gently.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Lower away!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRIDGE / FORWARD WELL DECK / FOC'SLE

               AT THE BOW

               The place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railing 
               goes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and 
               windlasses on the foc'sle deck.

               Smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well 
               deck. Water is shipped over the sides and the well deck is 
               awash. Two men run across the deck, their feet sending up 
               spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires another rocket. WHOOSH!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL

               Fabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears 
               Jack's voice.

                                     JACK
                         Fabrizio! Fabri!

               Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the 
               crowd. He and Jack hug like brothers.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         The boats are all going.

                                     JACK
                         We gotta get up there or we're gonna 
                         be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?

               Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd 
               to the stairwell.

               Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks 
               the head of the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or 
               so and a few women are squeezing through.

                                     STEWARD #2
                         Women only. No men. No men!!

               But some terrified men, not understanding English, try to 
               rush through the gap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and 
               stewards push them back, shoving and punching them.

                                     STEWARD #2
                         Get back! Get back you lot!
                              (to the crewmen)
                         Lock it!!

               They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 
               brandishes a small revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They 
               lock the gate, and a cry goes up among the crowd, who surge 
               forward, pounding against the steel and shouting in several 
               languages.

                                     TOMMY
                         For the love of God, man, there are 
                         children down here! Let us up, so we 
                         can have a chance!

               But the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation 
               get out of hand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and 
               pushes his way back through the crowd, going down the stairs. 
               He rejoins Jack, Rose and Fabrizio.

                                     TOMMY
                         It's hopeless that way.

                                     JACK
                         Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we 
                         better do it fast.

               Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself 
               understood.

                                     FABRIZIO
                              (with a lot of hand 
                              gestures)
                         Everyone... all of you... come with 
                         me now. We go to the boats. We go to 
                         the boats. Capito? Come now!

               They can't understand what he's saying. They can see his 
               urgency, but OLUF DAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes 
               his head. He will not panic, and will not let his family go 
               with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         Helga... per favore... please... 
                         come with me, I am lucky. Is my 
                         destiny to go to America.

               She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack 
               lays a hand on his shoulder, his eyes saying "Let's go".

                                     FABRIZIO
                         I will never forget you.

               He turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking 
               back Fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE

               CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy 
               watches, he pulls out two stacks of bills, still banded by 
               bank wrappers. Then he takes out "Heart of the Ocean", putting 
               it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the safe.

                                     CAL
                              (holding up stacks of 
                              bills)
                         I make my own luck.

                                     LOVEJOY
                              (putting the .45 in 
                              his waistband)
                         So do I.

               Cal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEERAGE, AFT

               Jack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way 
               out. They push past confused passengers... past a mother 
               changing her baby's diaper on top of an upturned steamer 
               trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in Serbo-
               Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling 
               to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, 
               sobbing... and past another man with an English/Arabic 
               dictionary, trying to figure out what the signs mean, while 
               his wife and children wait patiently.

               Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two 
               decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up 
               against a steel gate. The steerage men are yelling at a scared 
               STEWARD.

                                     STEWARD
                         Go to the main stairwell, with 
                         everyone else. It'll all get sorted 
                         out there.

               Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it.

                                     JACK
                         God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!

               He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the 
               landing. He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio 
               pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free. Rose 
               figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the 
               stairs between the waiting people.

                                     ROSE
                         Move aside! Quickly, move aside!

               Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT 
               INTO THE GATE with all their strength. It rips loose from 
               its track and falls outward, narrowly missing the steward. 
               Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose steps up to the 
               cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone:

                                     ROSE
                         If you have any intention of keeping 
                         your pathetic job with the White 
                         Star Line, I suggest you escort these 
                         good people to the boat deck... now.

               Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT 6 / TITANIC - NIGHT

               Ruth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the 
               incompetent sailors. She rests on her oars, exhausted, and 
               looks back at the ship.

               It slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. 
               Nothing is above water forward of the bridge except for the 
               foremast. Another rocket goes off, lighting up the entire 
               area... there are a dozen boats moving outward from the ship.

               AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL

               Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through a large metal 
               megaphone.

                                     SMITH
                         Come back! Come back to the ship!

               CHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle.

               FROM BOAT 6

               The whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster 
               Hitchins grips the rudder in fear.

                                     HITCHINS
                         The suction will pull us right down 
                         if we don't keep going.

                                     MOLLY
                         We got room for lots more. I say we 
                         go back.

                                     HITCHINS
                         No! It's our lives now, not theirs. 
                         And I'm in charge of this boat! Now 
                         row!!

               CAPTAIN SMITH

               At the rail of the boat deck, lowers his megaphone slowly

                                     SMITH
                         The fools.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A-DECK FOYER

               As Cal and Lovejoy cross the foyer encounter Benjamin 
               Guggenheim and his valet, both dressed in white tie, tail-
               coats and top hats.

                                     CAL
                         Ben, what's the occasion?

                                     GUGGENHEIM
                         We have dressed in our best and are 
                         prepared to go down like gentlemen.

                                     CAL
                         That's admirable, Ben.
                              (walking on)
                         I'll sure and tell your wife... when 
                         I get to New York.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

               There are still two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet 
               and civilized. A silver serving cart, holding a large humidor, 
               begins to roll slowly across the room. One of the cardplayers 
               takes a cigar from it as it rolls by.

                                     CARDPLAYER
                         It seems we've been dealt a bad hand 
                         this time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. A-DECK PROMENADE

               Cal and Lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride. 
               They pass CHIEF BAKER JOHGHIN, who is working up a sweat 
               tossing deck chairs over the rail. After they go by, Joughin 
               takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a pocket, 
               opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, 
               then stands there a little unsteadily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK AND A-DECK, AFT

               PANIC IS SETTING IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd 
               here is now a mix of all three classes. Officers repeatedly 
               warn men back from the boats. The crowd presses in closer.

               Seamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat 14 to discourage 
               a close press of men who look ready to rush the boat. Several 
               men break ranks and rush forward.

               Lightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Get back! Keep order!

               The men back down. Fifth Officer Lowe standing in the boat, 
               yells to the crew.

                                     LOWE
                         Lower away left and right!

               Lightoller turns away from the crowd and, out of their sight, 
               breaks his pistol open. Letting out a long breath, he starts 
               to LOAD IT.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE, AFT

               Cal and Lovejoy arrive in time to see Murdoch lowering his 
               last boat.

                                     CAL
                         We're too late.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         There are still some boats forward. 
                         Stay with this one... Murdoch. He 
                         seems to be quite... practical.

               IN THE WATER BELOW

               There is another panic. Boat 13, already in the water but 
               still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge 
               water being pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly 
               under boat 15, which is coming down right on top of it.

               The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop 
               lowering. They are ignored. Some men put their hands up, 
               trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of boat 15 from crushing 
               them.

               Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to 
               the after falls, climbing rudely over people. He cuts the 
               aft falls while another crewman cuts the forward lines. 13 
               drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds before it touches 
               the water with a slap.

               Cal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / A-DECK, PORT, AFT

               Fifth Officer Lowe, in Boat 14 is firing his gun as a warning 
               to a bunch of men threatening to jump into the boat as it 
               passes the open promenade on A-Deck.

                                     LOWE
                         Stay back you lot!

               BLAM! BLAM!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, AFT

               The shots echo away.

                                     CAL
                         It's starting to fall apart. We don't 
                         have much time.

               Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French 
               bulldog. Someone has released the pets from the kennels.

               Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start 
               walking toward the bow. He catches up and falls in beside 
               him.

                                     CAL
                         Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as 
                         you know, and I have a business 
                         proposition for you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT

               Jack, Rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew 
               stairs just aft of the third funnel. They look at the empty 
               davits.

                                     ROSE
                         The boats are gone!

               She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, 
               escorting two first class ladies.

                                     ROSE
                         Colonel! Are there any boats left?

                                     GRACIE
                              (staring at her 
                              bedraggled state)
                         Yes, miss... there are still a couple 
                         of boats all the way forward. This 
                         way, I'll lead you!

               Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy 
               and Fabrizio close behind.

               ANGLE ON THE BAND

               Incredibly they are still playing. Jack, Rose and the others 
               run by.

                                     TOMMY
                         Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in 
                         First Class.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, FORWARD

               Water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on B-
               Deck. CAMERA SWEEPS UP past A-Deck to the Boat Deck where 
               Murdoch and his team are loading Collapsible Car the forward-
               most davits.

               NOTE: There are four so-called collapsibles, or Engelhardts 
               boats, including two which are stored on the roof of the 
               officer's quarters.

               The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal slips 
               his hand out of the pocket of his overcoat and into the waist 
               pocket of Murdoch's greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills 
               there.

                                     CAL
                         So we have an understanding then?

                                     MURDOCH
                              (nodding curtly)
                         As you've said.

               Cal, satisfied, steps back. He finds himself waiting next to 
               J. Bruce Ismay. Ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's. 
               Lovejoy comes up to Cal at that moment.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         I've found her. She's just over on 
                         the port side. With him.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Women and children? Any more women 
                         and children?
                              (glancing at Cal)
                         Any one else, then?

               Cal looks longingly at his boat... his moment has arrived.

                                     CAL
                         God damn it to hell! Come on.

               He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut 
               through the bridge.

               Bruce Ismay, seeing his opportunity, steps quickly into 
               Collapsible C. He stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's 
               eyes.

                                     MURDOCH
                              (staring at Ismay)
                         Take them down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE - NIGHT

               ON THE PORT SIDE

               Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps his pistol 
               in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is 
               pouring into the doors and windows of B-Deck staterooms. 
               They can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Women and children, please. Women 
                         and children only. Step back, sir.

               Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering 
               in the cold. Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks 
               into the eyes of a HUSBAND she knows she may not see again

                                     HUSBAND
                         Goodbye for a little while... only 
                         for a little while.
                              (to his two little 
                              girls)
                         Go with mummy.

               The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her 
               tears from them. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is 
               choked with emotion.

                                     HUSBAND
                         Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. 
                         That's right.

               Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion 
               and have to be helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note 
               and hands it to a woman who is about to board.

                                     MAN
                         Please get this to my wife in 
                         DeMoines, Iowa.

               Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio.

                                     JACK
                         You better check out the other side.

               They nod and run off, searching for a way around the 
               deckhouse.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm not going without you.

                                     JACK
                         Get in the boat, Rose.

               Cal walks up just then.

                                     CAL
                         Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.

               She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. 
               Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip 
               and stockings, a shocking display in 1912.

                                     CAL
                         My God, look at you.
                              (taking off his boat)
                         Here, put this on.

               She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not 
               the cold.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat. 
                         Hurry, please!

                                     JACK
                         Go on. I'll get the next one.

                                     ROSE
                         No. Not without you!

               She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He 
               sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. 
               But then he leans close to her and says...

                                     CAL
                              (low)
                         There are boats on the other side 
                         that are allowing men in. Jack and I 
                         can get off safely. Both of us.

                                     JACK
                              (he smiles reassuringly)
                         I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can 
                         get going... we got our own boat to 
                         catch.

                                     CAL
                         Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.

               Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She 
               reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. 
               Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. It's all 
               a rush and blur.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Lower away!

               The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.

                                     CAL
                              (low)
                         You're a good liar.

                                     JACK
                         Almost as good as you.

                                     CAL
                         I always win, Jack. One way or 
                         another.
                              (looks at him, smiling)
                         Pity I didn't keep that drawing. 
                         It's going to be worth a lot more by 
                         morning.

               Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting 
               to waste a second of his last view of her.

               ROSE'S PERCEPTION - IN SLOW MOTION

               The ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to 
               lower. All sound going away... Lightoller giving orders, his 
               lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in her 
               ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in 
               slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's 
               hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending 
               away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at 
               the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable 
               pain she is feeling...

               Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.

               SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to 
               her. Reaches the gunwale, climbing it...

               Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck 
               promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. The 
               Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is back on Titanic.

                                     JACK
                         No Rose! NOOOO!!

               Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down 
               to A-Deck.

               Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for 
               this man, this gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so 
               all consuming it eclipses all thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GRAND STAIRCASE

               TRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer 
               and sprints down the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck 
               foyer, running toward him, Cal's long coat flying out behind 
               her as she runs.

               They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an 
               embrace.

                                     JACK
                         Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're 
                         such an idiot --

               And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight 
               as he can.

                                     ROSE
                         You jump, I jump, right?

                                     JACK
                         Right.

               Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he 
               sees them locked in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind 
               Cal and puts a restraining HAND on him, but Cal whips around, 
               grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband in one cobra-
               fast move.

               He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches 
               the landing above them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, 
               he FIRES.

               The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. 
               Jack pulls Rose toward the stairs going down to the next 
               deck. Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them. A 
               bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's 
               head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs.

               Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue 
               and goes sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. 
               He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet 
               deep. Jack and Rose come down the stairs two at a time and 
               run straight into the water, fording across the room to where 
               the floor slopes up, until they reach dry footing at the 
               entrance to the dining saloon.

               STEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time 
               to see Jack and Rose splashing through the water toward the 
               dining saloon. He FIRES twice. Big gouts of spray near them, 
               but he's not a great shot.

               The water boils up around his feet and he retreats up the 
               stairs a couple of steps. Around him the woodwork groans and 
               creaks.

                                     CAL
                              (calling to them)
                         Enjoy your time together!!

               Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something 
               and starts to laugh.

                                     LOVEJOY
                         What could possible be funny?

                                     CAL
                         I put the diamond in my coat pocket. 
                         And I put my coat... on her.

               He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes 
               glittering.

                                     CAL
                         I give it to you... if you can get 
                         it.

               He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. 
               Lovejoy thinks about it... then slogs into the water. The 
               icewater is up to his waist as he crosses the pool into the 
               dining saloon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DINING SALOON

               Lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, 
               searching... listening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a 
               sea of tables, and they could be anywhere. A silver serving 
               trolley rolls downhill, bumping into tables and pillars.

               He glances behind him. The water is following him into the 
               room, advancing in a hundred foot wide tide. The reception 
               room is now a roiling lake, and the grand staircase is 
               submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groans echo 
               through the ship.

               ON JACK AND ROSE

               Crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. They see 
               the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. 
               They crawl ahead of it to the next row of tables.

                                     JACK
                              (whispering)
                         Stay here.

               He moves off as --

               Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. 
               Nothing.

               The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.

               ANGLE ON A METAL CART

               Five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes. It starts 
               to roll down the aisle between tables.

               ON ROSE

               As the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks 
               of dishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering 
               her.

               She scrambles out of the way and --

               Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, 
               keeping the gun aimed --

               That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together 
               into a table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. 
               They land in the water which is flowing rapidly between the 
               tables.

               Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his 
               knee down on Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, 
               and kicks it away. Lovejoy scrambles up and lunges at him, 
               but Jack GUT PUCHES him right in the solar plexus, doubling 
               him over.

                                     JACK
                         Compliments of the Chippewa Falls 
                         Dawsons.

               He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate column. Lovejoy 
               drops to the floor with a splash, stunned.

                                     JACK
                         Let's go.

               Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind 
               them the tables have become islands in a lake... and the far 
               end of the room is flooded up to the ceiling.

               Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up 
               out of the water and wades after them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GALLEY / STAIRWELL

               They run through the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She 
               starts up and Jack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN.

               They crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the 
               stairs. Assuming they have gone up (who wouldn't?) he climbs 
               up them two at a time.

               They wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. 
               Then they hear it... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go 
               down a few steps to looks along the next deck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS

               The corridor is awash, about a foot deep. Standing against 
               the wall, about 50 feet away, is a little BOY, about 3. The 
               water swirls around his legs and he is wailing.

                                     ROSE
                         We can't leave him.

               Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the 
               stairwell to run to the child. Jack scoops up the kid and 
               they run back to the stairs but --

               A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. 
               In seconds it is too powerful for them to go against.

                                     JACK
                         Come on.

               Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast 
               up spray with each footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy 
               double doors. As Jack approaches them he sees water spraying 
               through the gap between the doors right up to the ceiling. 
               The doors groan and start to crack under the tons of pressure.

                                     JACK
                         Back! Go back!!

               Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn 
               into a cross-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He 
               sees the boy in Jack's arms and cries out, grabbing him away 
               from Jack. Starts cursing him in Russian. He runs on with 
               the boy --

                                     ROSE
                         No! Not that way! Come back!

               DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the 
               corridor. The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.

               Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming 
               from floor to ceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. 
               They make it to a stairway going up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Jack and Rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up 
               behind them. PULL BACK to reveal that a steel gate blocks 
               the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMS against the gate, gripping 
               the bars.

               A terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns 
               to run at the sight of the water thundering up the stairs.

                                     JACK
                         Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.

               The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, 
               pouring through the gate and slamming them against it. In 
               seconds it is up to their waist.

                                     ROSE
                         Help us! Please!

               The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at 
               the gate, their arms reaching through... sees the water 
               POURING through the gate onto the landing.

                                     STEWARD
                         Fucking 'ell!

               He runs back, slogging against the torrent. He pulls a key 
               ring from his belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as 
               the water fountains up around them.

               The lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.

               The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel.

                                     JACK
                         Come on! Come on!

               Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...

               Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing 
               through by the force of the water. They make it to stairs on 
               the other side of the landing and follow the steward up to 
               the next deck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE

               Cal comes reeling out of the first class entrance, looking 
               wild-eyed. The lurches down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz 
               music wafts over the ship. Somewhere the band is still 
               playing.

               CAL'S POV

               A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in the 
               alcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves on without 
               a glance back... reaching a large crowd clustered around 
               COLLAPSIBLE A just aft of the bridge. He sees Murdoch and a 
               number of crewmen struggling to drag the boat to the davits, 
               with no luck.

               Cal pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer 
               ignores him. Nearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed 
               forward by the crowd behind. PURSER MCELROY pushes them back, 
               getting a couple of seamen to help him. He brandishes his 
               gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to stay 
               back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT SIDE / ROOF OF OFFICERS' QUARTERS

               Lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying 
               to get Collapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down 
               a pair of oars leaned against the deck house.

                                     LIGHTOLLER
                         Hold it! Hold it!

               The weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the 
               deck, upside down. The two Swedish cousins, OLAUS and BJORN 
               GUNERSEN, jump back as the boat nearly hits them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Jack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship 
               groans and torgues around them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE

               Murdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd 
               is threatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling 
               and shouting at the officers. The pressure from behind pushes 
               them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck 
               into the water less than ten feet below.

                                     TOMMY
                         Give us a chance to live, you limey 
                         bastards!

               Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at 
               the crowd.

                                     MURDOCH
                         I'll shoot any man who tries to get 
                         past me.

               Cal steps up to him.

                                     CAL
                         We had a deal, damn you.

               Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal.

                                     MURDOCH
                         Get back!

               A man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from 
               behind. Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming 
               forward, puts a bullet into his chest.

               Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his 
               arms as his life flows out over the deck.

               Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts 
               the pistol to his temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet 
               with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat 
               deck into the water only a few feet below.

               Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black 
               water. The MONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, 
               the bills spreading across the surface.

               The crew rush to get the last few women aboard the boat.

                                     PURSER MCELROY
                              (calling above the 
                              confusion)
                         Any more women or children?!

               THE CHILD

               Crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward, 
               cradling her in his arms.

                                     CAL
                              (forcing his way 
                              through the crowd)
                         Here's a child! I've got a child!
                              (to McElroy)
                         Please... I'm all she has in the 
                         world.

               McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins 
               with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other 
               men back. Cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. 
               He takes a seat with the women.

                                     CAL
                         There, there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM

               Thomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at 
               the large painting above the mantle. The fire is still going 
               in the fireplace.

               The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off 
               the table. Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out 
               of breath and soaked. They run through, toward the aft 
               revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She sees that 
               his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.

                                     ROSE
                         Won't you even make a try for it, 
                         Mr. Andrews?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (a tear rolls down 
                              his cheek)
                         I'm sorry that I didn't build you a 
                         stronger ship, young Rose.

                                     JACK
                              (to her)
                         It's going fast... we've got to keep 
                         moving.

               Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Good luck to you, Rose.

                                     ROSE
                              (hugging him)
                         And to you, Mr. Andrews.

               Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS

               The band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the 
               orchestra members.

                                     HARTLEY
                         Right, that's it then.

               They leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts 
               his violin to his chin and bows the first notes of "Nearer 
               My God to Thee". One by one the band members turn, hearing 
               the lonely melody.

               Without a word they walk back and take their places. They 
               join in with Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches 
               all over the ship on this still night. The vocalist begins: 
               "If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to thee..."

               THE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:

               A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain 
               Smith as he walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith 
               seems to stare through him. Without a word he turns and goes 
               onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed WHEELHOUSE and closes 
               the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming brass 
               instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.

               IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

               Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls out his pocketwatch 
               and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the mantle 
               clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything 
               must be correct.

               IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE

               Water swirls in from the private promenade deck. Rose's 
               paintings are submerged. The Picasso transforms under the 
               water's surface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies 
               come to life.

               DOWN ANGLE

               On the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a 
               bed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss 
               stare at the ceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water 
               pours into the room through a doorway. It swirls around the 
               bed, two feet deep rising fast.

               IN A STEERAGE CABIN

               Somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young IRISH MOTHER, 
               seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her 
               two young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making 
               sure they are all warm and cozy. She lies down with them on 
               the bed, speaking soothingly and holding them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE

               IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the 
               bridge house sinks into the water.

               ON THE PORT SIDE

               Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working frantically, 
               the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't 
               drag it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife 
               and he saws furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around 
               his legs. The boat, still upside down, is swept off the ship. 
               Men start diving in, swimming to stay with it.

               IN COLLAPSIBLE A

               Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has completely 
               forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as 
               they work, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't 
               drag the collapsible under.

               Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles 
               to put it on as the water rises around him.

               CAPTAIN SMITH

               Standing near the wheel, watches the black water climbing 
               the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken 
               expression of a damned soul on Judgment Day. The windows 
               burst suddenly and a wall of water edged with shards of glass 
               slams into Smith. He disappears in a vortex of foam.

               Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. 
               It partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. 
               Over a hundred passengers are plunged into the freezing water 
               and the area around the boat becomes a frenzy of splashing, 
               screaming people.

               As men are trying to climb into the collapsible, Cal grabs 
               an oar and pushes them back into the water.

                                     CAL
                         Get back! You'll swamp us!

               Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. 
               The ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes 
               under the water, and he is dragged down. Underwater he 
               struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface. 
               He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.

               WALLACE HARTLEY

               Sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them. He 
               holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers 
               his violin.

                                     HARTLEY
                         Gentlemen, it has been a privilege 
                         playing with you tonight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A-DECK AFT, PORT SIDE

               Jack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. 
               Jack pushes his way to the rail and looks at the state of 
               the ship. The bridge is under water and there is chaos on 
               deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on. People stream around 
               them, shouting and pushing.

                                     JACK
                         Okay... we keep moving aft. We have 
                         to stay on the ship as long as 
                         possible.

               They push their way aft through the panicking crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL

               Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around 
               the sinking ship. It slams against the side of the forward 
               funnel.

                                     CAL
                              (to the crew in the 
                              boat)
                         Row! Row you bastards!!

               NEARBY

               Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT 
               as water pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring 
               down the ship traps him against it, and he is dragged down 
               under the surface as the ship sinks. He struggles to free 
               himself but cannot.

               Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the 
               ship as a furnace explodes and a blast of hot air belches 
               out of the ventilator, ejecting Fabrizio. He surfaces in a 
               roar of foam and keeps swimming.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A-DECK / B-DECK / WELL DECK, AFT

               Jack and Rose clamber over the A-Deck aft rail. Then, using 
               all his strength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding 
               on with one hand. She dangles, then falls. Jack jumps down 
               behind her.

               They join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling 
               over each other to get down the narrow stairs to the well 
               deck... the only way aft.

               Seeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the 
               B-Deck railing and helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and 
               she falls in a heap. Baker Joughin, now three sheets to the 
               wind, happens to be next to her. He hauls Rose to her feet. 
               Jack drops down and the three of them push through the crowd 
               across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are 
               jumping into the water.

               The ship GROANS and SHUDDERS. The man ahead of Jack is walking 
               like a zombie.

                                     MAN
                         Yeah, though I walk through the valley 
                         of the shadow of death --

                                     JACK
                         You wanna walk a little faster through 
                         that valley, fella?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL

               The stay cables along the top of the funnel snap, and they 
               lash like steel whips down into the water. Cal watches as 
               the funnel topples from its mounts. Falling like a temple 
               pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps into the water 
               with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath it 
               disappear in an instant.

               Fabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He 
               comes up, gasping... still swimming. The water pouring into 
               the open end of the funnel draws in several swimmers. The 
               funnel sinks, disappearing, but --

               Hundreds of tons of water pour down through the 30 foot hole 
               where the funnel stood, thundering down into the belly of 
               the ship. A whirlpool forms, a hole in the ocean, like at 
               enormous toilet-flush. T. W. McCauley, the gym instructor 
               swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He is sucked 
               down like a spider going down a drain.

               Fabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked 
               down behind him. He manages to get clear. He's going to live 
               no matter what it takes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / GRAND STAIRCASE

               Water roars through the doors and windows, cascading down 
               the stairs like a rapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the 
               marble steps to A-Deck, which is already flooded... a roiling 
               vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at the bottom of the 
               staircase and wraps his arms around it.

               Astor looks up in time to see the 30 foot glass dome overhead 
               EXPLODE INWARD with the wave of water washing over it. A 
               Niagara of sea water thunders down into the room, blasting 
               through the first class opulence. It is the Armageddon of 
               elegance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BELOW DECKS

               The flooding is horrific. Walls and doors are splintered 
               like kindling. Water roars down corridors with pile-driver 
               force.

               The CARTMELL FAMILY is at the top of a stairwell, jammed 
               against a locked gate like Jack and Rose were. Water boils 
               up the stairwell behind them. Bert Cartmell shakes the gate 
               futilely, shouting for help. Little Cora wails as the water 
               boils up around them all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STERN

               Rose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the 
               ship tilts. Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's 
               butt and shoves her up onto the deck.

                                     JOUGHIN
                         Sorry, miss!

               Hundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more 
               are pouring up every second. Jack and Rose cling together as 
               they struggle across the tilting deck.

               As the bow goes down, the STERN RISES. IN BOAT 2, which is 
               just off the stern, passengers gape as the giant bronze 
               propellers rise out of the water like gods of the deep, 
               FILLING FRAME behind them.

               People are JUMPING from the well deck, the poop deck, the 
               gangway doors. Some hit debris in the water and are hurt or 
               killed.

               EXT. STERN

               ON THE POOP DECK

               Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases. Hundreds 
               of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle 
               on their knees around FATHER BYLES, who has his voice raised 
               in prayer. They are praying, sobbing, or just staring at 
               nothing, their minds blank with dread.

               Pulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose 
               aft along the deck.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, Rose. We can't expect God 
                         to do all the work for us.

               They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN 
               loses his footing ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps 
               him.

               THE PROPELLERS

               Are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.

               JACK AND ROSE

               Make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the flagpole. 
               They grip the rail, jammed in between other people. It is 
               the spot where Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two 
               night... and a lifetime... ago.

               Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, 
               cracking with emotion.

                                     FATHER BYLES
                         ...and I saw new heavens and a new 
                         earth. The former heavens and the 
                         former earth had passed away and the 
                         sea was no longer.

               The lights flicker, threatening to go out. Rose grips Jack 
               as the stern rises into a night sky ablaze with stars.

                                     FATHER BYLES
                         I also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy 
                         city coming down out of heaven from 
                         God, beautiful as a bride prepared 
                         to meet her husband. I heard a loud 
                         voice from the throne ring out this 
                         is God's dwelling among men. He shall 
                         dwell with them and they shall be 
                         his people and He shall be their God 
                         who is always with them.

               Rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed. Near them 
               are the DAHL FAMILY, clinging together stoically. Helga looks 
               at her briefly, and her eyes are infinitely sad.

               Rose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five 
               year old son, who is crying in terror.

                                     MOTHER
                         Shhh. Don't cry. It'll be over soon, 
                         darling. It'll all be over soon.

                                     FATHER BYLES
                         He shall wipe every tear from their 
                         eyes. And there shall be no more 
                         death or mourning, crying out or 
                         pain, for the former world has passed 
                         away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHIP - VARIOUS

               As the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside 
               shifts.

               CUPBOARDS

               Burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of 
               china. A PIANO slides across the floor, crashing into a wall. 
               FURNITURE tumbles across the Smoking Room floor.

               ON THE A-DECK PROMENADE

               Passengers lose their grip and slide down the wooden deck 
               like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the 
               water. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along 
               the railing and slides away screaming.

               AT THE STERN

               The propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising. 
               Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming 
               and hit the water like mortar rounds. A man falls from the 
               poop deck, hitting the bronze hub of the starboard propeller 
               with a sickening smack.

               SWIMMERS LOOK UP

               And see the stern towering over them like a monolith, the 
               propellers rising against the stars. 110 feet. 120.

               AT THE STERN RAIL

               A man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever, right 
               past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC / BOAT

               TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship 
               and the screaming people come across the water.

               REVERSE / HER POV

               IN A WIDE SHOT we see the spectacle of the Titanic, her lights 
               blazing, reflecting in the still water. Its stern is high in 
               the air, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers 
               are 150 feet out of the water. Over a thousand passengers 
               cling to the decks, looking from a distance like a swarm of 
               bees.

               The image is shocking, unbelievable, unthinkable. Ruth stares 
               at the spectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any 
               proportion.

                                     MOLLY BROWN
                         God Almighty.

               The great liner's lights flicker.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ENGINE ROOM

               In darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the 
               master breaker panel. Around him men climb through tilted 
               cyclopean machines with electric hand-torches. It is a black 
               hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and groaning machinery 
               threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.

               Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will 
               not leave his post. CLUNK. The breakers kick. He slams them 
               in again and -- WHOOM! a blast of light! Something melts and 
               arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish light --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC

               WIDE SHOT

               The lights go out all over the ship. Titanic becomes a vast 
               black silhouette against the stars.

               IN COLLAPSIBLE C

               Bruce Ismay has his back to the ship, unable to watch the 
               great steamer die. He is catatonic with remorse, his mind 
               overloaded. He can avert his eyes, but he can't block out 
               the sounds of dying people and machinery.

               A loud CRACKING REPORT comes across the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOAT DECK

               Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He 
               stares down as the DECK SPLITS right between his feet. A 
               yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of breaking steel Lovejoy 
               is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. 
               He watches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right 
               in front of him. He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing 
               straight down into the bowels of the ship, amid a BOOMING 
               CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. People falling into 
               the widening crevasse look like dolls.

               The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks 
               like whips, ripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit 
               by a whipping cable and snatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable 
               smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and it rips free. He falls 
               backward into the pit of jagged metal.

               Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the 
               hull splits down through nine decks to the keel. The sea 
               pours into the gaping wound --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ENGINE ROOM

               It is a thundering black hell. Men scream as monstrous 
               machinery comes apart around them, steel frames twisting 
               like taffy. Their torches illuminate the roaring, foaming 
               demon of water as it races at the through the machines. Trying 
               to climb they are overtaken in seconds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TITANIC - NIGHT

               The STERN HALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, 
               falls back toward the water. On the poop deck everyone screams 
               as they feel themselves plummeting. The sound goes up like 
               the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored.

               Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few 
               unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them 
               like God's bootheel. The massive stern section falls back 
               almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a 
               mighty wave of displaced water.

               Jack and Rose struggle to hold onto the stern rail. They 
               feel the ship seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying 
               think it is salvation.

                                     SEVERAL PEOPLE
                         We're saved!

               Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly.

               Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the 
               awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts 
               up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF ASCENT as the fantail angles 
               up again. Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, 
               ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern 
               lifts.

               The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty.

               People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down 
               the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto something. 
               They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. 
               There is a pile-up of bodies at the forward rail. The DAHL 
               FAMILY falls one by one.

                                     JACK
                         We have to move!

               He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She 
               is terrified to move. He grabs her hand.

                                     JACK
                         Come on! I've got you!

               Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled 
               her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other 
               direction. She gets over just as the railing is going 
               HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely.

               The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black 
               monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like 
               that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable.

               Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to 
               the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People 
               near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, 
               their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by 
               one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. 
               Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.

               Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face 
               of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. 
               Just beneath their feet are the gold letters "TITANIC" 
               emblazoned across the stern.

               Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below 
               to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, 
               crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a 
               surreal moment.

                                     JOUGHIN
                              (nodding a greeting)
                         Helluva night.

               The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section 
               floods. Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop 
               like an elevator with Jack and Rose.

                                     JACK
                              (talking fast)
                         Take a deep breath and hold it right 
                         before we go into the water. The 
                         ship will suck us down. Kick for the 
                         surface and keep kicking. Don't let 
                         go of my hand. We're gonna make it 
                         Rose. Trust me.

               She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his 
               hand harder.

                                     ROSE
                         I trust you.

               Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers 
               speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and 
               then rushes up the last thirty feet.

               IN A HIGH SHOT

               We see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name 
               "TITANIC" disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose 
               vanish under the water.

               Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black 
               ocean.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE

               Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others 
               struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and 
               tumbles them.

               Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... 
               holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up.

               AT THE SURFACE

               A roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a 
               thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. 
               Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, 
               praying, moaning, shouting... screaming.

               Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to 
               gasp for air before people are clawing at them. People driven 
               insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so 
               intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire.

               A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... 
               senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto 
               anything. Jack PUNCHES him repeatedly, pulling her free.

                                     JACK
                         Swim, Rose! SWIM!

               She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because 
               of her life jacket. They break out of the clot of people. He 
               has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out 
               of the freezing water.

                                     JACK
                         Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come on, 
                         you can do it.

               All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and 
               moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... 
               nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense 
               of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN

               Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from 
               freezing.

                                     JACK
                         Look for something floating. Some 
                         debris... wood... anything.

                                     ROSE
                         It's so cold.

                                     JACK
                         I know. I know. Help me, here. Look 
                         around.

               His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing 
               around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to 
               draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS.

               A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH 
               BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the 
               darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it 
               is headed for Newfoundland.

               Beyond it Rose sees something in the water.

                                     ROSE
                         What's that?

               Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it 
               together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. 
               He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down.

               But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and 
               submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big 
               enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping 
               his upper body out of the water as best he can.

               Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from 
               exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of 
               debris. Jack warns him back.

                                     JACK
                         It's just enough for this lady... 
                         you'll push it under.

                                     MAN
                         Let me try at least, or I'll die 
                         soon.

                                     JACK
                         You'll die quicker if you come any 
                         closer.

                                     MAN
                         Yes, I see. Good luck to you then.
                              (swimming off)
                         God bless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN

               The boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the 
               sides in the water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as 
               their only hope. Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in 
               the water as a warning.

                                     CAL
                         Stay back! Keep off!

               Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to 
               the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp.

                                     FABRIZIO
                         You don't... understand... I have... 
                         to get... to America.

                                     CAL
                              (pointing with the 
                              oar)
                         It's that way!

               CLOSE ON FABRIZIO

               As he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit 
               leave him.

               FABRIZIO'S POV

               Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in 
               a tuxedo. The image fades to black.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN

               JACK AND ROSE

               Still float amid a chorus of the damned. Jack sees the ship's 
               officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle 
               furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for 
               miles.

                                     JACK
                         The boats will come back for us, 
                         Rose. Hold on just a little longer. 
                         They had to row away for the suction 
                         and now they'll be coming back.

               She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering 
               uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering.

                                     ROSE
                         Thank God for you Jack.

               People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats.

                                     WOMAN
                         Come back! Please! We know you can 
                         hear us. For God's sake!

                                     MAN
                         Please... help us. Save one life! 
                         SAVE ONE LIFE!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN

               IN BOAT 6

               Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness. 
               The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to 
               the sounds of hundreds screaming.

                                     HITCHINS
                         They'll pull us right down I tell 
                         ya!

                                     MOLLY
                         Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. 
                         Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's 
                         go.
                              (nobody moves)
                         Well come on!

               The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine 
               wraps.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't understand a one of you. 
                         What's the matter with you? It's 
                         your men back there! We got plenty 
                         a' room for more.

                                     HITCHINS
                         If you don't shut that hole in yer 
                         face, there'll be one less in this 
                         boat!

               Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it 
               all out.

               IN BOAT ONE

               Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon sit with ten other people 
               in a boat that is two thirds empty. They are two hundred 
               yards from the screaming in the darkness.

                                     FIREMAN HENDRICKSON
                         We should do something.

               Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. 
               She is terrified.

                                     SIR COSMO
                         It's out of the question.

               The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They 
               hunch guiltily, hoping the sound will stop soon.

               TWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of 
               them make a move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN

               Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is 
               glassy, with only the faintest undulating swell. Rose can 
               actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of the 
               sea.

               Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in 
               tightly around her legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk 
               with in the darkness. A low MOANING in the darkness around 
               them.

                                     ROSE
                         It's getting quiet.

                                     JACK
                         Just a few more minutes. It'll take 
                         them a while to get the boats 
                         organized...

               Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the 
               truth. There won't be any boats. Behind Jack she sees that 
               Officer Wilde has stopped moving. He is slumped in his 
               lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of exposure 
               already.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know about you, but I intend 
                         to write a strongly worded letter to 
                         the White Star Line about all this.

               She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose 
               finds his eyes in the dim light.

                                     ROSE
                         I love you Jack.

               He takes her hand.

                                     JACK
                         No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. 
                         Don't you give up. Don't do it.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm so cold.

                                     JACK
                         You're going to get out of this... 
                         you're going to go on and you're 
                         going to make babies and watch them 
                         grow and you're going to die an old 
                         lady, warm in your bed. Not here. 
                         Not this night. Do you understand 
                         me?

                                     ROSE
                         I can't feel my body.

                                     JACK
                         Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning 
                         that ticket was the best thing that 
                         ever happened to me.

               Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.

                                     JACK
                         It brought me to you. And I'm 
                         thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.

               His voice is trembling with the cold which is working its 
               way to his heart. But his eyes are unwavering.

                                     JACK
                         You must do me this honor... promise 
                         me you will survive... that you will 
                         never give up... no matter what 
                         happens... no matter how hopeless... 
                         promise me now, and never let go of 
                         that promise.

                                     ROSE
                         I promise.

                                     JACK
                         Never let go.

                                     ROSE
                         I promise. I will never let go, Jack. 
                         I'll never let go.

               She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. 
               It is quiet now, except for the lapping of the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN - NIGHT

               Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten 
               Boats 10, 12 and Collapsible D together with his own Boat 
               14. A demon of energy, he's had everyone hold the boats 
               together and is transferring passengers from 14 into the 
               others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.

               As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees 
               a shawled figure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl 
               off, and finds himself staring into the face of a man. He 
               angrily shoves the stowaway into another boat and turns to 
               his crew of three.

                                     LOWE
                         Right, man the oars.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN / BOAT

               The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a 
               searchlight as boat 14 comes toward us.

               ANGLE FROM THE BOAT

               As the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant trail 
               of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed 
               photo of a steerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph 
               camera.

               Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like 
               sign posts, the first bodies come into the torch's beam. The 
               people are dead but not drowned, killed by the freezing water. 
               Some look like they could be sleeping. Others stare with 
               frozen eyes at the stars.

               Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the 
               oars on the heads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. 
               One seaman throws up. Lowe sees a mother floating with her 
               arms frozen around her lifeless baby.

                                     LOWE
                              (the worst moment of 
                              his life)
                         We waited too long.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN

               IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the 
               black water. The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and 
               the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space. 
               They are absolutely still. Their hands are locked together. 
               Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above 
               her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep 
               steals over Rose, and she feels peace.

               CLOSE ON ROSE'S FACE

               Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be floating 
               in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows 
               she is dying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of 
               Jack's song:

                                     ROSE
                         "Come Josephine in my flying 
                         machine..."

               ROSE'S POV

               The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a 
               glorious band from horizon to horizon.

               A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.

               TIGHT ON ROSE AGAIN

               We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals. Her 
               breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes 
               track down from the stars to the water.

               ROSE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

               The silhouette of a boat crossing the stars. She sees men in 
               it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, 
               leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of 
               the men sound slow and DISTORTED.

               Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light 
               flares across the water, silhouetting the bobbing corpses in 
               between. It flicks past her motionless form and moves on. 
               The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her. The men look 
               away.

               Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair 
               has frozen to the wood under her.

                                     ROSE
                              (barely audible)
                         Jack.

               She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't 
               respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed 
               with frost.

               He seems to be sleeping peacefully.

               But he is not asleep.

               Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization 
               goes through her.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, Jack.

               All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. 
               It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches 
               them go.

               She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to 
               be no reason to even try.

               And then... her eyes snap open.

               She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips 
               her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so 
               weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the 
               torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to 
               draw breath, calling again.

               IN THE BOAT

               Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, 
               turning the tiller.

               ROSE

               Struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen 
               to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and 
               gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling 
               film.

                                     ROSE
                         I won't let go. I promise.

               She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems 
               to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.

               Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the 
               icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs 
               his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the 
               strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water.

               IN BOAT 14

               Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.

                                     LOWE
                              (turning the tiller)
                         Row back! That way! Pull!

               Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still 
               blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they 
               haul her into the boat. She slips into unconsciousness and 
               they scramble to cover her with blankets...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH

               EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present 
               day.

                                     OLD ROSE
                         Fifteen hundred people went into the 
                         sea when Titanic sank from under us. 
                         There were twenty boats floating 
                         nearby and only one came back. One. 
                         Six were saved from the water, myself 
                         included. Six out of fifteen hundred.

               As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of 
               Lizzy and the salvage crew on Keldysh. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, 
               the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years 
               before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose 
               has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first 
               time, they do feel like graverobbers.

               Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about 
               the diamond.

                                     OLD ROSE
                         Afterward, the seven hundred people 
                         in the boats had nothing to do but 
                         wait... wait to die, wait to live, 
                         wait for an absolution which would 
                         never come.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the 
               saved.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANOTHER BOAT

               And then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the survivors: 
               Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping 
               from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... 
               Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently.

               IN BOAT 14

               CLOSE ON ROSE

               Lying swaddled. Only her face is visible, white as the moon. 
               The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon 
               everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it 
               is all silent, SLOW MOTION.

               IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE

               We see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts 
               and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human 
               emotion.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN

               Golden light washes across the white boats, which gloat in a 
               calm sea reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a 
               flotilla of sailing ships, are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits 
               nearby, as boats row toward her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY

               IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, 
               with the letters "CARPATHIA" visible on the bow... Rose 
               watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank... seamen helping 
               survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway 
               doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the 
               ship... ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, 
               so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song 
               of love lost forever.

               THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside 
               of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... 
               Rose being draped with warm blankets and given hot tea... 
               Bruce Ismay climbing aboard. He has the face and eyes of a 
               damned soul.

               As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward 
               the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing 
               widows. He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY

               It is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces 
               of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of 
               Carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the 
               recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch cover sits an 
               enormous pile of lifebelts.

               He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a 
               steward approaches him.

                                     CARPATHIA STEWARD
                         You won't find any of your people 
                         back here, sir. It's all steerage.

               Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking 
               under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another.

               Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he 
               approaches her. He barely recognizes her. She looks like a 
               refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.

                                     CAL
                         Rose... your mother and I have been 
                         looking for you --

               She holds up her hand, stopping him.

                                     ROSE
                         Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. 
                         We will make a deal, since that is 
                         something you understand. From this 
                         moment you do not exist for me, nor 
                         I for you. You shall not see me again. 
                         And you will not attempt to find me. 
                         In return I will keep my silence. 
                         Your actions last night need never 
                         come to light, and you will get to 
                         keep the honor you have carefully 
                         purchased.

               She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which 
               changed their lives.

                                     ROSE
                         Is this in any way unclear?

                                     CAL
                              (after a long beat)
                         What do I tell your mother?

                                     ROSE
                         Tell her that her daughter died with 
                         the Titanic.

               She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal 
               stricken with emotion.

                                     CAL
                         You're precious to me, Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. 
                         Hockley.

               We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly 
               love her.

               After a moment, he turns and walks away.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         That was the last time I ever saw 
                         him. He married, of course, and 
                         inherited his millions. The crash of 
                         28 hit his interests hard, and he 
                         put a pistol in his mouth that year. 
                         His children fought over the scraps 
                         of his estate like hyenas, or so I 
                         read.

               ANGLE ON ROSE

               At the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes 
               up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, 
               welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as 
               Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind.

               LATER CARPATHIA DISGORGES THE SURVIVORS

               At the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the 
               dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes 
               of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an 
               amazing tableau.

               Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packed 
               with friends and relatives, officials, ambulances, and the 
               press --

               Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at 
               the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and 
               trucks... it is the 1912 equivalent of a media circus. They 
               jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as 
               they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.

               Rose is covered with a woolen shawl and walking with a group 
               of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them 
               questions as they come off the gangway.

                                     IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                         Name?

                                     ROSE
                         Dawson. Rose Dawson.

               The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. 
               Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of 
               photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and 
               the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near 
               her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace 
               an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. 
               The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes 
               explode.

               Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes 
               through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none 
               challenges her in the confusion.

                                     OLD ROSE (V.O.)
                         Can you exchange one life for another? 
                         A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. 
                         If a mindless insect can do it, why 
                         couldn't I? Was it any more 
                         unimaginable than the sinking of the 
                         Titanic?

               TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further 
               until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and she 
               is still walking, determined.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH

               Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by 
               the blue glow of the screens. She holds the haircomb with 
               the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled hands.

                                     BODINE
                         We never found anything on Jack. 
                         There's no record of him at all.

                                     OLD ROSE
                         No, there wouldn't be, would there? 
                         And I've never spoken of him until 
                         now, not to anyone.
                              (to Lizzy)
                         Not even your grandfather. A woman's 
                         heart is a deep ocean of secrets. 
                         But now you all know there was a man 
                         named Jack Dawson, and that he saved 
                         me, in every way that a person can 
                         be saved.
                              (closing her eyes)
                         I don't even have a picture of him. 
                         He exists now only in my memory.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN FLOOR / TITANIC WRECK

               The Mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We 
               hear Yuri the pilot on the UQC:

                                     YURI
                         Mir One returning to surface.

               The sub rises off the deck of the wreck, taking its light 
               with it, leaving the Titanic once again it its fine and 
               private darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KELDYSH DECK

               A desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. 
               There is music and some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are 
               dancing. Bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of 
               Baker Joughin.

               Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. 
               Lizzy comes to him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand 
               on his arm.

                                     LIZZY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     LOVETT
                         We were pissin' in the wind the whole 
                         time.

               Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at 
               the stern of the ship.

                                     LOVETT
                         Oh shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK

               Rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her 
               nightgown blows in the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands 
               are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying.

               ON LOVETT AND LIZZY

               Running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass.

               ROSE

               Reaches the stern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the 
               rail. Her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes 
               herself up, leaning forward. Over her shoulder, we see the 
               black water glinting far below.

               LOVETT AND LIZZY

               Run up behind her.

                                     LIZZY
                         Grandma, wait!! Don't --

               Rose turns her head.

               Looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has 
               something in her hand, something she was about to drop 
               overboard.

               It is the "Heart of the Ocean".

               Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. 
               Rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't come any closer.

                                     LOVETT
                         You had it the entire time?!

                                                              FLASH CUT TO:

               SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE

               Walking away from Pier 54. The photographers' flashes go off 
               like a battle behind her. She has her hands in her pockets. 
               She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace. 
               She stares at it in amazement.

               BACK ON KELDYSH

               Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.

                                     ROSE
                         The hardest part about being so poor, 
                         was being so rich. But every time I 
                         though of selling it, I though of 
                         Cal. And somehow I always got by 
                         without his help.

               She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the 
               other guys come up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in 
               Rose's hand.

                                     BODINE
                         Holy shit.

                                     LOVETT
                         Don't drop it Rose.

                                     BODINE
                              (a fierce whisper)
                         Rush her.

                                     LOVETT
                              (to Bodine)
                         It's hers, you schmuck.
                              (to her)
                         Look, Rose, I... I don't know what 
                         to say to a woman who tries to jump 
                         off the Titanic when it's not sinking, 
                         and jumps back onto it when it is... 
                         we're not dealing with logic here, I 
                         know that... but please... think 
                         about this a second.

                                     ROSE
                         I have. I came all the way here so 
                         this could go back where it belongs.

               The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds 
               out his hand...

                                     LOVETT
                         Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. 
                         Please. Just once.

               He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly 
               moving up to her at the stern of Titanic.

               Surprisingly, she calmly places the massive stone in the 
               palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. 
               Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of cold 
               scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is mesmerizing. It 
               fits in his hand just like he imagined.

                                     LOVETT
                         My God.

               His grip tightens on the diamond.

               He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly 
               infinitely wise and deep.

                                     ROSE
                         You look for treasures in the wrong 
                         place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is 
                         priceless, and making each day count.

               His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips 
               the diamond out of his hand. He feels it sliding away.

               Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace 
               over the rail. Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to 
               the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear 
               forever.

                                     BODINE
                         Aww!! That really sucks, lady!

               Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a 
               reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his 
               eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.

                                     LOVETT
                         Would you like to dance?

               Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at 
               the stars.

               IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN

               The diamond sinks, twinkling end over end, into the infinite 
               depths.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH

               A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged 
               pictures:

               Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a 
               theatrically lit studio publicity shot... Rose and her 
               husband, with their two children... Rose with her son at his 
               college graduation... Rose with her children and grandchildren 
               at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived 
               well.

               THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. 
               She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The 
               Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her. She 
               is grinning, full of life.

               WE PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her 
               bunk. A profile shot. She is very still. She could be 
               sleeping, or maybe something else.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACKNESS

               THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It 
               is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass 
               over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure, moving 
               faster than subs can move... almost like we are flying.

               WE GO INSIDE

               And the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The 
               rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it 
               is transformed... We EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by 
               glowing chandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room 
               is populated by men in tie and tails, women in gowns. It is 
               exquisitely beautiful.

               IN POV

               We sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlemen 
               and ladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a 
               man stands with his back to us... he turns and it is Jack. 
               Smiling he holds his hand out toward us.

               IN A SIDE ANGLE

               Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers, 
               officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in 
               the utter silence of the abyss.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
